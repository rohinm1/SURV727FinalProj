I think what you guys are doing is incredible. You’re fighting for our rights and freedoms, and, right now, it feels like we’re a little bit at war and those rights and freedoms are at stake,” said in the video posted to the social media platform Twitter on Monday.Supporting the truckers from one radio band to another 💙 #FreedomConvoy2022 pic.twitter.com/u6IzZSipTG— EA (@erinhoward0118) January 24, 2022Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) confirmed that it was investigating the actions of constable Howard, stating, “We were made aware today of a video circulating on social media from one of our uniformed members regarding the Freedom Rally,” broadcaster CBC reports.“The views expressed in that video do not reflect the views and opinions of DRPS. We are currently looking into this matter,” the DRPS added.Howard is also a member of the “Police on Guard” group, which is critical of vaccine mandates and lockdown restrictions and is said to have joined the group in May of last year.The group states that it is opposed to the emergency measures used by the government during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic stating, “We believe that these measures are not only in conflict with our Charter Oath but also place active duty police officers in an untenable position when directed by politicians and senior management to enforce these emergency measures.”Millions Raised As Hundreds of Canadian Truckers Drive To Capital To Protest Vaccine Mandatehttps://t.co/PQVqeTKT6U— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 25, 2022The Canadian trucker convoy, dubbed the “Freedom convoy” has raised over 4.4 million Canadian dollars (£2.58 million/$3.48 million USD) as of Tuesday and is said to already involved hundreds of participants planning on arriving in Ottawa on Saturday.The vaccine mandate came into force for cross border travel into Canada on January 15th and affects as many as 26,000 truckers. The United States enacted the same policy to enter the country from Canada just days later on January 22nd.The protest also comes as Canada is facing supply chain disruptions across the country. Alberta conservative Premier Jason Kenney called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to end the vaccine mandate for truckers saying, “Nobody wants to see empty shelves and higher prices. We need some common sense here. Ottawa should drop the vax mandate for truckers now.”Others, such as federal Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) leader Erin O’Toole have been more hesitant on the issue, with Mr O’Toole avoiding questions about the Freedom Convoy on Monday.A quarter of Canadians support putting unvaccinated people in jail, and two-thirds say they would support mandatory vaccinations. https://t.co/DwIKmO6tCT— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 21, 2022Despite the money raised for the convoy, a new poll released by Nanos Research on Monday suggested that a majority of Canadians not only agree with vaccine mandates but 60 per cent support or somewhat support the idea of having unvaccinated people fined by the government.The poll comes after Quebec Premier Francois Legault announced he would be implementing a significant tax on the unvaccinated, which he termed as a “health contribution.”Other polls have shown some Canadians to be even more radical in their views toward the unvaccinated, backing mandatory vaccines for children as young as five and around a quarter of Canadians supporting prison time for the unvaccinated.UNVAX TAX: Coming to a government near you https://t.co/U07tkW2Cq6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 12, 2022"

In the meantime, I’ve never seen a more diverse group of Canadians,” he said, to rousing cheers. “Far from violent, people want to not be violated anymore.

Transfers will then be made directly to the people in need. Our lawful team are happy to deal with any discrepancies,” the fundraising page said.Both media outlets and GoFundMe managers asked for more details about these financial arrangements, but there was no public response from either Greer or “Ironbark Thunderbolt.” According to ABC News, some convoy participants used Facebook to voice “confusion and frustration” with their inability to collect reimbursement for their expenses from the GoFundMe account as promised.On Monday, GoFundMe froze the $160,000 raised by the campaign until its creator “completes the verification process, and is able to provide documentation to our team about how funds will be distributed.”A GoFundMe spokesperson later warned that “fundraisers raising money to promote misinformation about vaccines violate GoFundMe’s terms of service and will be removed.”The demonstration, variously billed as “Millions March Against Mandatory Vaccination” and “The 2022 Official Convoy to Canberra Terra Australis,” produced a crowd of about 800 demonstrators who marched from Canberra’s Federation Mall to Parliament House, where they held a rally, listened to speeches, sang defiant songs, and demanded to speak with a parliamentary representative. The crowd drew close enough to the Parliament building to make Australian Federal Police nervous, even though the legislature will not be in session until next week. Some attendees told ABC News they planned to camp on the lawn until Parliament was in session.The Canberra Times described the scene on Monday:Protesters were seen waving the red ensign flag, flags in support of Donald Trump, the Canadian flag and the Knights Templar flag.Australian red ensign flags – which is the same as the Australian flag but for the color – has been co-opted by self-described ‘sovereign citizens’. They are a group of people who believe laws do not apply to them.People also held signs, saying this such as “End The Mandates” and “No Jabs 4 Jobs”. Another said, “if liars’ pants really did catch fire, watching the news would be a lot more entertaining”.A protest leader named Romeo Georges complained the Australian government “gave you money, they told you ‘we love you, we care about you’ and then they come for your kid.”“If you want to take [COVID in] your immune system, it’s your right to do that,” Georges said, as quoted by the Canberra Times.Hundreds of anti-vaxxers have reached the front doors of Parliament House protesting against COVID jabs.

No announcement has been made as to when he is likely to appear in public again.“I’m feeling fine — and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted,” Trudeau tweeted.This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I’m feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 31, 2022He has been in isolation since last Wednesday when he said that he’d had a positive contact.As Breitbart News reported, last week Trudeau dismissed the convoys of truck drivers as angry, isolated loners on the fringe of society.Trudeau commented on the “Freedom Convoy” at a press conference on Wednesday evening saying, “The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa, who are holding unacceptable views that they are expressing, do not represent the views of Canadians.”Supporters of the Freedom Convoy protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions on January 29, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)“(Canadians) who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country,” Trudeau added.He spoke even as convoy members were able to raise millions of dollars to aid their cause and fight the government’s coronavirus vaccine mandates.Millions Raised As Hundreds of Canadian Truckers Drive To Capital To Protest Vaccine Mandatehttps://t.co/PQVqeTKT6U— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 25, 2022On Sunday, photos and video poured swamped social media revealing the truckers forming in protest at the country’s vaccine mandate had a tremendous amount of support from Canadians of all walks of life.Thousands of those supporters took to the nation’s frozen streets well into the dark of night in solidarity with the grass roots movement."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/01/31/triple-vaxxed-coronavirus-positive-justin-trudeau-getting-vaccinated-defines-being-canadian/,"Acceptance of coronavirus vaccines is about “being there for each other” and “defines what being a Canadian is,” leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.Trudeau made the remarks during a remote press conference from an undisclosed location in response to a demonstration in Ottawa, ON, of truckers and other protesters opposed to vaccine mandates.Trudeau framed coronavirus vaccination as a prerequisite to ending governmentally-decreed lockdowns and shutdowns. Restoration of “freedom,” he added, requires a higher degree of vaccination across the public. Trudeau’s remarks alternated between English and French. Statements made in French were translated to English in real-time by CPAC, a public affairs channel run by a consortium of cable TV companies analogous to C-SPAN.“The protesters are talking about freedom,” Trudeau said. “Well, Canadians know that freedom means getting back to the things that they used to enjoy, and the way to be able to do that is to get vaccinated. The way that we built this country was by being there for each other. That’s what defines what being Canadian is.”He continued, “So while this fringe minority is protesting, the vast majority of Canadians are thinking, ‘Come on.’ It’s by continuing to be there for each other that we will get through this pandemic. We all want to be done with this pandemic, but the vast majority of Canadians know very well the way out is not protesting the pandemic, it’s getting vaccinated.”Protestors show their support for the Freedom Convoy of truck drivers who are making their way to Ottawa to protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the Canadian government on Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022, in Vaughan. (Photo by Arthur Mola/Invision/AP)Trudeau repeatedly advised all Canadians to accept coronavirus vaccines, framing the medical treatment as an altruistic behavior to protect others.The prime minister repeatedly framed vaccines as the only “way out of this pandemic.”
“The vast majority of Canadians know that [protesting] is not how we can end this pandemic,” he claimed. “The way out of this pandemic is getting vaccinated. It’s listening to public health advice, and the best way to get out of this pandemic and to continue to be there for each other is to show that we understand the importance of following science, facts, and health experts. That’s how we’ll get out of this pandemic.”Despite claiming to have received two doses of coronavirus vaccines and a “booster,” Trudeau said he had “tested positive for [Chinese coronavirus]” and will be “working remotely” for the week."

https://www.breitbart.com/health/2022/02/01/canada-police-all-options-on-the-table-to-end-peaceful-trucker-protests/,"Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters on Monday that “all options are on the table,” including “enforcement,” to end an ongoing protest led by truckers in the Canadian capital against the country’s onerous anti-coronavirus mandates that Sloly himself admitted had led to no injuries or violence.“It could have led to significant and severe injuries, and it could have led to the loss of life. None of that has occurred over the last four days,” Sloly said, according to Canada’s CTV, while asserting that police would act by any means necessary to end the event.Sloly’s remarks follow a bizarre speech by far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – from an undisclosed location in which he is allegedly recovering from a Chinese coronavirus infection – in which he condemned the protesters as wearing “tinfoil hats,” compared them unfavorably to violent “Black Lives Matter” protests, and equated receiving coronavirus vaccine products to “what being Canadian is.”Trudeau has adamantly refused to address the protesters’ concerns and dismissed them as a “small fringe minority” that is representative of neither truckers nor Canadians generally.The “Freedom Convoy” of thousands in Ottawa is demanding an end to all business, travel, education, and movement restrictions in the country. A GoFundMe page for the campaign, which has attracted upwards of 9 million Canadian dollars in donations, demands Trudeau’s government “cease all mandates against its people.”“Small businesses are being destroyed, homes are being destroyed, and people are being mistreated and denied fundamental necessities to survive. It’s our duty as Canadians to put an end to this mandates,” the page reads. “It is imperative that this happens because if we don’t, our country will no longer be the country we have come to love.  We are doing this for our future Generations and to regain our lives back.”Sloly, the Ottawa police chief, told reporters that “all options are on the table, from negotiation through to enforcement,” to end the event. He did not specify if lifting the mandates was among those options.Similarly, in the same briefing, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asserted that he and his local government were “doing everything possible to bring this to an end peacefully.” Unlike Sloly, he explicitly rejected using force to dislodge the peaceful assembly.“I get a lot of emails and tweets, why don’t you just send in the tow trucks, send in the parking control people? We’re not interested in inflaming the situation,” Watson asserted. “The last thing we need is to have some behavior that creates a mini-riot. We don’t want that to happen. We don’t want to see bloodshed.”Watson urged the protesters to “give back our city to its residents.”“It should have ended a long time ago. They’ve made their point. They had their rally,” Watson reportedly complained. “They embarrassed themselves with some of the actions of some of the people in the crowd, but it’s now time for them to go home and allow our community to regroup and rebuild, particularly given the fact that we’re still in the midst of a pandemic.”Images from the protests largely align with Sloly’s assessment that the ongoing event has been peaceful. Reporters have caught protesters cleaning up public spaces they have used. Much of the activity in the heart of the city appears to be dancing and playing music, creating a celebratory atmosphere at odds with the mood created in the past two years in the country by the Trudeau administration’s pandemic policies.Freedom Convoy participants clean and take care of the Terry Fox memorial in Ottawa. pic.twitter.com/XBxyGX80Zv— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) January 31, 2022-21C / wind chill -35C.

Poso 🏁 (@JackPosobiec) January 30, 2022Trudeau has aggressively refused to address the protesters’ concerns or meet with them. During remarks on Monday, the prime minister told a reporter asking him to defend his stance on not meeting the protesters that he would only meet with those he agrees with.“I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agree with the goals, [and] when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues. Black Lives Matter is an excellent example of that,” Trudeau said.Trudeau attended a Black Lives Matter protest in Ottawa in 2020, taking a knee as a gesture of support for the cause. Trudeau’s support for the causes of racial minorities has largely been undermined by his own enthusiasm for wearing “blackface,” a racist practice where a white person darkens their skin to mock black people. In 2019, Trudeau described himself as being “more enthusiastic about costumes than … is sometimes appropriate” and admitted that he had worn blackface so many times that he could not remember them all.Elsewhere in his remarks on Tuesday, Trudeau condemned the anti-mandate protesters as “hateful” and “fringe.”“I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect – not just of science – but of the frontline health workers and, quite frankly, the 90 percent of truckers who have been doing the right thing [by receiving coronavirus vaccines] to keep Canadians safe to put food on our tables,” Trudeau told reporters from his undisclosed hideout.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

I want to be very clear: we are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless,” Trudeau said.“We won’t give in to those who fly racist flags. We won’t cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonour the memory of our veterans,” he added.Trudeau’s allegations were rejected by Rebel News founder Ezra Levant, an attendee of the protest, who told Breitbart News that Prime Minister Trudeau’s allegations were “complete B.S.”Millions Raised As Hundreds of Canadian Truckers Drive To Capital To Protest Vaccine Mandatehttps://t.co/PQVqeTKT6U— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 25, 2022 "

His Church of God Restoration, which has a congregation of about 200, accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for violating the ban to hold services and events. In November 2020, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shut down a drive-in prayer service by physically blocking the entrance to the church parking lot. A hundred congregants showed up anyway and were dispersed by the RCMP, except for one “adult male” who refused to leave and was fined $1,296.Tissen racked up several of those $1,296 personal fines himself, while the church was repeatedly fined $5,000 for holding events. Tissen considered the fines unjust and vowed to fight them in court. His supporters questioned the absurdity of banning “drive-in” services in freezing cold weather where all of the attendees sat in their own tightly-sealed cars.Tonight I was fined more then 17k for attending and leading church when the province thinks I should Quarantine.If there is anything essential to a pastor, it is to be at church.Other people are exempt for ""essential"" reasons.

Six other churches joined Tissen in protesting this restriction as a violation of their religious freedoms.“We have no authority scripturally based and based on Christian convictions to limit anyone from coming to hear the word of God,” Tissen testified in court.Tissen accused the authorities of intimidating his family while they tried to carry out the warrant for his arrest:(1/2)My wife and children were pulled over tonight on their way to the caroling event and they asked if I was in the car.

He was explicitly given permission to hold religious services and perform his duties as a pastor. Tissen called this adjustment to the conditions of his release “miraculous” and said he would not have left jail unless his religious freedom was protected.“In Ephesians, it says that we’re fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places and principalities and powers. That’s it, right now, what we see. And they’re after all of us who are giving to God what belongs to God and to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. But now, Caesar wants that which belongs to God. And as Christians, we just cannot. We cannot comply with that,” he said after his release.Tissen’s supporters credited his arrest and release as a watershed moment in Canadian resistance to some of the world’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns and mandates, leading up to the massive convoy of truckers currently protesting vaccine mandates in Ottawan, to the great discomfort of leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Tissen, an enthusiastic supporter of the Freedom Convoy, dedicated his performance of “Amazing Grace” at the border post in Emerson, Manitoba, on Sunday to the truckers.

Trudeau admitted to the initial photos as more surfaced of him in racist costumes on other occasions. Asked by reporters if knew of other instances in which he had worn blackface, he admitted that there were too many of them and he could not be “definitive” about how many.“I am wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,” Trudeau acknowledged.On Monday, Bergen accused Trudeau of being divisive and “gaslighting” Canadians, saying, “All Canadians want to see a leader who will work to heal rifts, not further divide. A leader who will listen, even to those voices he might not agree with. A leader who will work to understand, not dismiss, name-call, and gaslight.”Bergen was in the middle of a heated debate with Trudeau’s Minister of Public Safety, Marco Mendicino, who responded saying, “I think we all support free speech in this House, but there’s a big difference between free speech and inciting hatred, inciting violence, desecrating war memorials, Mr. Speaker, and I would hope my honorable colleague would denounce that in the clearest terms.”He called the protesters “radical leaders” who “are not really interested in free speech because they want to pretend as though vaccines don’t work.”Bergen, to raucous applause, condemned all “hateful and destructive acts by a few at any protest,” making sure to note many instances of leftist violence and statue desecration in Canada.“Whether it’s beheading the statue of Queen Victoria in Manitoba, tearing down the statue of Sir John A. [Macdonald] in Montreal, or putting flags on Terry Fox,” she said.Bergen recited a list: “Whether it’s burning down churches, whether it’s wearing blackface, whether it’s Hezbollah flags, or NAZI flags, we all condemn it. But I’m not talking about that.”Mendicino then accused the protesters – who, according to the Ottawa police chief, have engaged in no violence or property destruction – of having “called for the incitement of violence, to overthrow this government, who have caused significant disruption by flagrantly ignoring public healthcare measures that have forced shops and businesses to close, that have desecrated war memorials.”“They’re not interested in free speech, they’re not interested in discourse, and they’re certainly not interested in advancing our way out of this pandemic,” he continued. [Emphasis added].To this, Bergen appeared to accuse Mendicino of lying, saying, “That minister is not telling the truth and it’s shameful to see what he is doing,” before being stopped by the Speaker for decorum.

At the location, he continued to undermine the protesters by giving a speech in which he said they were wearing “tinfoil hats,” and he said receiving the vaccine to take care of one another is “what being Canadian is.” He also said that he did not meet with the Freedom Convoy because he did not “agree” with them, unlike with leftist Black Lives Matter protesters, whom he kneeled before in 2020.“I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agree with the goals, [and] when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/01/canada-police-all-options-on-the-table-to-end-peaceful-trucker-protests/,"Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters on Monday that “all options are on the table,” including “enforcement,” to end an ongoing protest led by truckers in the Canadian capital against the country’s onerous anti-coronavirus mandates that Sloly himself admitted had led to no injuries or violence.“It could have led to significant and severe injuries, and it could have led to the loss of life. None of that has occurred over the last four days,” Sloly said, according to Canada’s CTV, while asserting that police would act by any means necessary to end the event.Sloly’s remarks follow a bizarre speech by far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – from an undisclosed location in which he is allegedly recovering from a Chinese coronavirus infection – in which he condemned the protesters as wearing “tinfoil hats,” compared them unfavorably to violent “Black Lives Matter” protests, and equated receiving coronavirus vaccine products to “what being Canadian is.”Trudeau has adamantly refused to address the protesters’ concerns and dismissed them as a “small fringe minority” that is representative of neither truckers nor Canadians generally.The “Freedom Convoy” of thousands in Ottawa is demanding an end to all business, travel, education, and movement restrictions in the country. A GoFundMe page for the campaign, which has attracted upwards of 9 million Canadian dollars in donations, demands Trudeau’s government “cease all mandates against its people.”“Small businesses are being destroyed, homes are being destroyed, and people are being mistreated and denied fundamental necessities to survive. It’s our duty as Canadians to put an end to this mandates,” the page reads. “It is imperative that this happens because if we don’t, our country will no longer be the country we have come to love.  We are doing this for our future Generations and to regain our lives back.”Sloly, the Ottawa police chief, told reporters that “all options are on the table, from negotiation through to enforcement,” to end the event. He did not specify if lifting the mandates was among those options.Similarly, in the same briefing, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asserted that he and his local government were “doing everything possible to bring this to an end peacefully.” Unlike Sloly, he explicitly rejected using force to dislodge the peaceful assembly.“I get a lot of emails and tweets, why don’t you just send in the tow trucks, send in the parking control people? We’re not interested in inflaming the situation,” Watson asserted. “The last thing we need is to have some behavior that creates a mini-riot. We don’t want that to happen. We don’t want to see bloodshed.”Watson urged the protesters to “give back our city to its residents.”“It should have ended a long time ago. They’ve made their point. They had their rally,” Watson reportedly complained. “They embarrassed themselves with some of the actions of some of the people in the crowd, but it’s now time for them to go home and allow our community to regroup and rebuild, particularly given the fact that we’re still in the midst of a pandemic.”Images from the protests largely align with Sloly’s assessment that the ongoing event has been peaceful. Reporters have caught protesters cleaning up public spaces they have used. Much of the activity in the heart of the city appears to be dancing and playing music, creating a celebratory atmosphere at odds with the mood created in the past two years in the country by the Trudeau administration’s pandemic policies.Freedom Convoy participants clean and take care of the Terry Fox memorial in Ottawa. pic.twitter.com/XBxyGX80Zv— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) January 31, 2022-21C / wind chill -35C.

Poso 🏁 (@JackPosobiec) January 30, 2022Trudeau has aggressively refused to address the protesters’ concerns or meet with them. During remarks on Monday, the prime minister told a reporter asking him to defend his stance on not meeting the protesters that he would only meet with those he agrees with.“I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agree with the goals, [and] when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues. Black Lives Matter is an excellent example of that,” Trudeau said.Trudeau attended a Black Lives Matter protest in Ottawa in 2020, taking a knee as a gesture of support for the cause. Trudeau’s support for the causes of racial minorities has largely been undermined by his own enthusiasm for wearing “blackface,” a racist practice where a white person darkens their skin to mock black people. In 2019, Trudeau described himself as being “more enthusiastic about costumes than … is sometimes appropriate” and admitted that he had worn blackface so many times that he could not remember them all.Elsewhere in his remarks on Tuesday, Trudeau condemned the anti-mandate protesters as “hateful” and “fringe.”“I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect – not just of science – but of the frontline health workers and, quite frankly, the 90 percent of truckers who have been doing the right thing [by receiving coronavirus vaccines] to keep Canadians safe to put food on our tables,” Trudeau told reporters from his undisclosed hideout.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/02/coronavirus-mandates-start-dropping-in-canada-as-freedom-convoy-rolls-on/,"Regional governments in Canada have begun announcing plans to drop onerous civil rights restrictions on their citizens meant to contain the Chinese coronavirus this week following mounting pressure from national protests, most prominently the “Freedom Convoy” in Ottawa.The “Freedom Convoy,” initially led by truckers but now a movement of thousands of people, arrived in the national capital this weekend demanding an end to lockdowns, business restrictions, mask mandates, vaccine mandates, and other restrictions in effect as a result of the pandemic. Protesters have vowed to remain in the capital until the government of far-left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lifts all such restrictions. Trudeau is currently in an undisclosed location recovering from an alleged coronavirus infection but has issued remarks from that location dismissing the protesters as racist, violent “tinfoil hat” wearers.Local police disagree. While Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly warned this week that “all options are on the table” to end the protests, he admitted that authorities had not documented any incidents of violence.“It could have led to significant and severe injuries, and it could have led to the loss of life. None of that has occurred over the last four days,” Sloly said on Monday.On Monday, Quebec Premier François Legault was the first to announce changes to coronavirus policies since a weekend of widespread peaceful protests in the capital. Legault walked back a plan to implement an extra tax on individuals who have not received doses of a Chinese coronavirus vaccination product. The initial plan was to tax unvaccinated people at higher rates on the grounds that they would allegedly be a burden to the government healthcare system because they would contract more severe cases of Chinese coronavirus. The tax would have forced its victims to pay up to $800 Canadian dollars, or about $630 USD.Quebec Prime Minister Francois Legault takes part during a press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the airline industry in Montreal, Quebec on July 15, 2021. – The funding announcement, towards greener aeronautic companies and electric aeronautics, was done in conjunction with the Quebec Prime Minister François Legault, and various company CEOs, such as CAE and Pratt and Whitney Canada. (Photo by Andrej Ivanov/AFP via Getty Images)“I understand this divides Quebecers,” an apologetic Legault said on Tuesday. “It’s time to work together.”Canada’s Global and Mail noted in its coverage of Quebec scrapping the plan that the tax would have “raised legal and logistical issues” that may have resulted in it never being implemented at all. The plan had prompted nationwide outrage, which Legault acknowledged in his remarks, stating that he hoped to “rebuild bridges” with those offended.At least four other Canadian provinces have announced either an end to vaccine-related travel restrictions or at least a plan to come up with an exit strategy for the current status quo this week. Saskatchewan, one of the provinces with milder restrictions, announced that the “vaccine passport” program would not continue in place past February. Premier Scott Moe told reporters that he did not believe coronavirus vaccines were making any significant difference in containing the spread of the virus, noting that both he and Trudeau were fully vaccinated when they tested positive.“It’s quite obvious that the virus itself has adapted through Omicron and transmits among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals quite freely,” Moe asserted.The premier also cited public dissatisfaction with the policies as a reason to get rid of them.“People are asking their government for a return to normal, a removal of public health restrictions,” he said.“At present, all Saskatchewan residents must show proof that they have received two shots of the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine to enter restaurants, bars, and other businesses. They also have the option to provide a negative COVID-19 test,” the CBC noted.Alberta, home to one of the largest anti-mandate protests in the country, issued a similar announcement, but its premier promised only the partial removal of restrictions.“Once we begin to see a sustained reduction in COVID pressure on the hospitals, I am looking forward to being able to make decisions about moving toward relaxation of public health measures at that time,” Premier Jason Kenney said on Tuesday. “I believe that will happen this month.”Kenney explicitly mentioned frustrations regarding vaccine mandates imposed on truck drivers.“The restriction on unvaccinated truck drivers doesn’t make sense and it’s going to further force up food prices and create challenges for supplies, including food,” Kenney said, indicating that a recent visit to Washington was precisely meant to encourage the United States to drop such limitations on Canadians.Truckers and allied protesters have blocked the border between Alberta and the United States in Coutts, a border municipality, and refused to leave. This protest is an extension of the “Freedom Convoy” in Ottawa. Reports indicate that local companies have refused to tow away the protesters, complicating law enforcement attempts to end the assembly.The governments of British Columbia and Manitoba have also issued similar but more cautious remarks indicating optimism that restrictions on free movement were weeks away from ending.A poll released on Monday by the Angus Reid Institute found that a plurality of Canadians agrees with the goal of the protests – to end the restrictions on individual rights in the name of public health. About 54 percent of respondents agreed with repealing all mandates, a 15-percent increase from the results of the same poll at the beginning of the month.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

(Photo by Dave Chan / AFP) (Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)At a press conference Tuesday, Kenney called for “calm” and said that he had heard reports of “people allied with the protesters assaulting RCMP officers, including one instance trying to ram members of the RCMP [with a vehicle].”“This kind of conduct is totally unacceptable,” Kenney continued. “Assaulting law enforcement officers who were simply doing their job to maintain public safety and the rule of law is completely unacceptable.”RCMP Cpl. Curtis Peters, who is on the ground in Coutts, independently confirmed to Breitbart News that no such assault took place, and the incident with the vehicle was an accident that occurred between civilians.“There were no RCMP officers assaulted,” he said. “There was an assault that took place between two civilians. One of them was a protester who had been traveling the wrong way on a one-way lane of highway and then got in a collision with the innocent person. … But we haven’t had any assaults of police.”According to Peters, the collision caused a fight to break out between the drivers.While Kenney said that the protesters have “refused to negotiate in good faith with the RCMP,” Peters told Breitbart News that communications have been “constant” and “ongoing.”Peters said the RCMP’s goal is to peaceably “bring this around to opening the roadway,” and added that in the past several hours, the truckers had agreed to open one lane of traffic for the northbound and southbound access. “But that wasn’t really opening up the border and bringing vehicles down, it just sort of allowed some more people to leave that had originally taken part in the protests and wanted out. That was done on their own accord,” he said. “We’ve been told that might be a temporary thing.”In the negotiations, the truckers are maintaining that unless all the mandates are dropped, they are not leaving.While “nobody’s been seriously hurt,” Peters said, “there’s still conflict.”One such instance of conflict has to do with Coutts Mayor Jim Willett, who has reported harassment from some supporters of the protest.According to Peters, Willett — who represents a town of 245 persons as of Canada’s last published census — said he has protesters outside his residence harassing him.“The fight isn’t with the mayor,” Peters said. “He has no stake in the game when it comes to mandates. He’s trying to keep this community trucking along.”The RCMP has also been tracking online threats to the mayor, but could not confirm to Breitbart News that those threats were coming from protesters.Peters says he cannot predict when an end to the blockade, which entered its fifth day Wednesday, will come.Breccan F.

Quebec imposed numerous lockdowns and other public health mandates throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Quebec does not allow unvaccinated people in large retail stores, restaurants, or other public events.Over the weekend, The convoy reached the country’s capital city, Ottawa. They are reportedly traveling to Quebec next.A Facebook event for the Quebec Freedom Convoy read:Montreal/Quebec City convoy in support of the Truckers heading to the Quebec City Parliament. The city of Ottawa is preparing to dismantle the demonstration. Many truckers have not been able to get in and many en route will not be able to get in either so they are heading to Quebec City.Quebec law enforcement authorities have contacted the Freedom Convoy organizers and said, “We will respect the right to protest.”Unlike Premier Legault, Trudeau refused to meet with the protesters. Instead, he and his family fled their Ottawa home due to “security concerns.” Trudeau has consistently criticized the Freedom Convoy, characterizing them as a group of “hateful” citizens who are “very often misogynistic and racist.” The Canadian Prime Minister also said the convoy is a “small fringe minority of people” that holds “unacceptable views.”Despite Trudeau’s attempt to diminish the freedom convoy’s size, it is clear that thousands of people support them. A GoFundMe page for the Freedom Convoy raised over $10 million before ultimately being frozen by the platform.“Those who are in their comfort zone, they think everything is going well, because they have the QR code … We’re your brothers, your sisters, your work mates, your friends, we need your help,” said Bernard Gauthier, an organizer of the Quebec protest. “We’re one of you.

That’s what I am hearing. That’s what our MLAs are hearing from most of their constituents.”Moe asserted that people now better understand the virus and how to treat it than they did two years ago at the outset of the pandemic … when the government said that restrictive measures would last two weeks.“They understand what they need to do. They understand the risk and they are prepared to live with that risk, more than they are prepared to live with the ongoing government intrusion into their lives,” he said.“Remember when this first started so very long ago? Government measures were supposed to last, I think, two weeks. Well, it’s been two years,” he added.JUST IN – Premier Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, a Canadian province that borders the US: ""It's time to look at ending all remaining Covid measures and restrictions.""pic.twitter.com/OTyHwWXrYr— Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) February 3, 2022Noting the presence of widely available vaccines, anti-viral treatments, and widespread testing options, Moe said that the conversation needs to start about when Canadians can get back to their normal life.“It’s time for us to have an honest conversation about Covid and our path forward,” he said. “What I’m about to say will sound radical to some and some quite frankly are not going to like it, but eradicating Covid is not realistic and Covid zero is not achievable. But normalizing Covid or living with Covid most certainly is.”“I’m concerned that Covid being the constant topic of conversation and dictating our daily lives will have a negative long-term impact on each of us in this province,” he continued. “Calls for daily government intrusion into peoples lives, skepticism regarding anything that is remotely positive that is related to Covid.”The premier’s statement comes as Canadian truckers have formed a “Freedom Convoy” in protest of the country’s vaccine mandates. On Tuesday, the Quebec premier said that he is willing to meet with the protesters and spark a conversation in contrast with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who fled the capital city of Ottawa and has maligned the truckers as a “fringe minority.”“I am always available to meet with people who are in good faith to try to see how we can help them answer their questions, their concerns,” said Premier Francois Legault."

According to the Ottawa police service official website, Ottawa has just 1,480 police officers.Sloly admitted that escalating the situation by bringing in the military was not a strategy without significant drawbacks. Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Viera quoted Sloly as saying, “Mixing them into a population in a highly volatile population … may mitigate some risk but escalate” others.Since the remarkable comments on deploying the military to confront pro-freedom truckers, a spokesman for the Canadian Defence Ministry said they would not be getting involved. The Toronto Star quoted the spokesman’s denial of the military being deployed to the streets of the capital, who said: “The Canadian Armed Forces are not involved in law enforcement in this situation, and there are no plans for such CAF involvement”.Quebec Abandons Policy of Taxing the Unvaccinated https://t.co/UVkaXrj361— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 2, 2022The statements by Ottawa’s police chief come just days after he stated that “all options are on the table” to deal with the protesters, who are demanding an end to vaccine mandates for truckers for cross border travel between the United States and Canada as well as an end to all coronavirus restrictions across the country.In the days since the Freedom Convoy arrived in Ottawa, some Canadian politicians have begun to discuss ending coronavirus-linked limitations on basic rights, including Saskatchewan conservative premier Scott Moe, who stated that the province would end restrictions such as the vaccine passport system by the end of the month.Premier Francois Legault of the French-speaking province of Quebec also announced this week that his government would be scrapping the idea of a tax on unvaccinated residents, claiming that the policy could lead to social tensions.Ottawa’s local government has slammed the Freedom Convoy protestors, with Ottawa city councillor Mathieu Fleury posted a note on Twitter on Monday that he would be launching court actions to seize cash from the GoFundMe fundraiser for the protests, which has amassed over ten million Canadian dollars as of Wednesday.“This morning I have asked the city manager and city solicitor to immediately launch court proceedings targeting the millions of dollars in funds frozen by GoFundMe so Ottawa taxpayers are not left holding the bag for these protests,” Fleury said before locking his account and making his Tweets private, which they remain as of Wednesday. Following the comments, GoFundMe actually froze the Trucker fundraiser, publishing a statement saying they were reviewing the account.They said: “This fundraiser is currently paused and under review to ensure it complies with our terms of service and applicable laws and regulations.

So when you have a mandate that requires you to tell everybody what your health status is to enter a country or have a job, it is wrong.”“I think it’s a private issue between yourself, your doctor, your spouse. It’s not for public knowledge. It’s not for your government to know,” he added.When asked how truckers can specifically influence policy in ways that other protests cannot, Durr put it bluntly: “When the wheels stop, the world stops.”“You need truckers,” Durr said. “You need truckers to get the products from the ships to the stores, from the stores to the factories, and from the factories to the stores. From the railyards, from the airport, it takes a truck. You’ll never move product without a truck. They are needed.”“When they are saying that they are not going to accept this, they will affect policy. I firmly believe it,” he added.Regarding the challenges these vaccine mandates imposed on truckers that might not be obvious to the average citizen, Durr noted that truckers already work a job in isolation. From a trucker’s perspective, the mandates appear less like a public health measure and more like a tool for political control.“It’s always about control,” Durr said. “We’ve been social distancing in trucking long before it became a popular phrase. We spent hours, days, weeks in a truck alone, and you just have yourself to deal with. You have the long hauls. I used to do the long hauls. I used to run to Quebec. It is hard enough to go through the border crossings. Now to add a medical procedure to go through the border. It’s just ridiculous. It is a punishment of sorts.”Supporters of the Freedom Convoy protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions in front of Parliament on January 29, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. – Hundreds of truckers drove their giant rigs into the Canadian capital Ottawa on Saturday as part of a self-titled “Freedom Convoy” to protest vaccine mandates required to cross the US border. (Photo by Dave Chan/AFP via Getty Images)Durr noted that millions of migrants cross the southern border into the United States every day, and few, if any, are being asked to present a vaccine passport.When the Canadian “Freedom Convoy” launched late last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attempted to dismiss it as little more than a “fringe minority” composed of racists and kooks. Durr noted that Trudeau should check his own racist past before maligning hardworking people.“Justin Trudeau, I don’t know him personally, but he is a joke,” said Durr. “For somebody who can go and call other individuals racist with the things he has done in the past just seems absurd.”Beyond Canada, Durr believed that the truckers in America should be inspired by their friends up north and even form their own “Freedom Convoy” in Washington, DC.I think their voices definitely need to be heard. I think the only way that people hear things is when you protest. They were concerned with police brutality when Black Lives Matter started protesting. It seems like they were concerned with all the other activists when they would protest. So why shouldn’t truck drivers protest and let their voices be heard and state that this is a discrimination against them?Driving a truck across the border is no different than driving your car up and down the highway. They are isolated. They do not touch anybody. They don’t see anybody. What is the reason? It’s just politics.In his home state of New Jersey, Durr said he would continue to fight for people’s bodily autonomy in the face of government mandates. He is currently sponsoring a bill (S1106) that seeks to prohibit the “mandatory use of medical devices by minors without informed parental consent.”“We have a major issue here in New Jersey with parents being concerned about their children being masked in schools,” he said. “I presented a bill this week (S1106) that would do away with the masking because it would put it in the parents’ hands. It would do away with the school deciding and would allow the parents to decide.”"

Sloly had previously stated on Monday that police had no evidence of violence or major disruptions at the congregation of thousands in the capital city, which is calling for an end to vaccine passports, sanitary mask mandates, and all civil rights violations in the name of containing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.Trudeau made the remarks during a “virtual” press conference from an undisclosed location where he has been in hiding since announcing that he tested positive for Chinese coronavirus.“One has to be very, very cautious before deploying military in situations engaging Canadians. It is not something that anyone should enter in lightly,” Trudeau said, according to the Globe and Mail. “But as of now, there have been no requests and that is not in the cards right now.”How DARE blackface enthusiast Justin Trudeau call ANYONE ""racist."" https://t.co/y8PcwfHl8i— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 2, 2022Trudeau has severely condemned the protesters in the past, accusing them without evidence of being racists and misogynists for opposing lockdowns and mandates.“The concerns expressed by a few people gathered in Ottawa, right now, are not new, not surprising, are heard,” Trudeau said during remarks from the undisclosed location on Monday, “but are a continuation of what we’ve unfortunately seen in disinformation and misinformation, online conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats.”Trudeau’s resistance to using the military to dislodge the protesters appears to be an attempt to diminish concerns prompted by Sloly during a briefing on Wednesday. As Ottawa police chief, Sloly is in charge of maintaining order and public safety on the streets.“This is a national issue, not an Ottawa issue. I am increasingly concerned there is no policing solution to this,” Sloly said. He estimated that it would take about 50,000 officers to seal the city to prevent people from out of town from joining the protesters; Ottawa has less than 1,500.Sloly conceded that a military response to a peaceful protest may “mitigate some risk, but escalate” the situation.Prior to those remarks, on Monday, Sloly said that “all options are on the table” for ending the protests, even while conceding that they were not violent.A woman waves a flag and cheers on truckers in protest of COVID-19 vaccine mandates on January 30, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. (Alex Kent/Getty Images)“It could have led to significant and severe injuries, and it could have led to the loss of life. None of that has occurred over the last four days,” Sloly told reporters.At the same press event, the mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, promised that his government was “doing everything possible to bring this to an end peacefully.”The protests are referred to as the “Freedom Convoy” because they have been led nationwide by convoys of truckers, who have been among the most vocal in opposing vaccine mandates to travel across Canadian provinces given the nature of their world. The convoy amassed the support of thousands of vehicles nationwide and drove into the capital last weekend, using car horns to honk loudly in protest in front of government buildings and demand an end to all restrictions.While Sloly had described “negotiation” as one of the many options on the table, Trudeau dismissed this on Thursday, insisting he would not lift any federal civil rights limitations related to the pandemic. Trudeau implied that the opponents of the mandates were seeking to overthrow a democratically elected government, without citing any remarks by any protesters or protest organizers that would support this claim.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family have reportedly fled their home in Ottawa for “a secret location,” as thousands of truckers traveling in a “freedom convoy” to protest vaccine mandates made their way to its capital city. https://t.co/ZMKF6EEw8z— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 30, 2022“So having a group of people who disagree with the outcome of an election, who want to go a different way and bring in an alternative government is a non-starter in a responsible democracy,” Trudeau said, according to the Globe and Mail.Authorities are preparing for an expected influx of protesters this weekend as the protests gain popularity. Reports indicate hotels in the city are full and police intelligence is planning for much larger populations to join the crowds.Popularity for the protests has grown due to mounting signs that they are succeeding.While Trudeau has rejected negotiating with the protesters on policy in any way, the governments of various provinces have begun discussing an end to vaccine passports and mandates.Quebec announced on Monday that it would no longer implement a planned tax on people who had not received the government’s allotted doses of a Chinese coronavirus vaccine product that would have likely faced legal challenges.Officials in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia have also openly begun discussing lifting civil rights restrictions by the end of February, policy changes they had not expressed openness to before the protests.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.  "

This remains a very volatile and very dangerous demonstration.”Ottawa Police chief Peter Sloly also gave a press conference Friday, going over many of the same points as the Ottawa police Twitter thread, but also denied that officers were permitted to support the Freedom Convoy protestors with food, fuel or other logistics and said any police officer caught doing so would be investigated and possibly prosecuted.

It is not something that anyone should enter in lightly,” Trudeau said and added, “But as of now, there have been no requests and that is not in the cards right now.”Police in Ottawa have stated that they have intelligence that the number of protestors joining the Freedom Convoy to protest vaccine mandates and Wuhan coronavirus restrictions will increase this weekend. https://t.co/iYltMFrhMN— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 4, 2022Trudeau, who fled Ottawa for security reasons last weekend and remains isolating due to a positive Wuhan coronavirus test, has maintained that he will not speak with the protestors, claiming they have “expressed hateful rhetoric” and disrespected science and frontline healthcare workers. Unlike the Canadian Prime Minister, Canadian provincial leaders have been more receptive to protestors demands to end vaccine mandates, vacation passports and other coronavirus restrictions, with Saskatchewan Premier Scott More stating that his province would be ending its vaccine passport by the end of February.Earlier this week, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has also pledged to scrap the vaccine passport system, while Quebec Premier Francois Legault dropped a controversial tax on the unvaccinated and stated he was open to speaking with members of the Freedom Convoy movement.Alberta Could Lift Vaccine Passport in ‘Days’, Denies Negotiating With Trucker Blockadehttps://t.co/4s6AIIRJMw— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2022"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/watch-ottawa-freedom-convoy-supporter-do-i-look-like-a-white-supremacist/,"OTTAWA, Ontario – “Do I look like a white supremacist?” a protester identifying himself as Daz asked Breitbart News jokingly on Wednesday, pointing to his dark skin, when asked about news media narratives of “white supremacy” among supporters of the Freedom Convoy.Assorted news media outlets have characterized the ongoing demonstration in downtown Ottawa as motivated by “white supremacy.” Leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau derided trucker protesters and their fellow demonstrators as “conspiracy theorist” wearers of “tinfoil hats.” He also denigrated Canadian citizens opposing his policies and ideology as members of “anti-vaxxer mobs” who are “racist,” “misogynistic,” and “don’t believe in science.”The Associated Press framed Saturday’s demonstration as characterized by swastikas, Confederate flags, and desecrations of war memorials without providing any photographic or video evidence. CTV operatives tweeted accusations of protestors taking food from homeless shelters, waving swastikas, and going maskless into a Tim Hortons.“White supremacy” is a “red herring” and false narrative, Daz stated.He continued, “They always mention white supremacy. White supremacy who?  Give me his name. Give me his business. Give me his locations. It’s always about a red herring. I’m not going to fall for these kinds of narratives.”“If you see me, do I look like a white supremacist?” he added. “I’m not even part of that narrative. I’m not even supporting that. I don’t even want to talk about it to be honest, so let’s just put down on the side, because we already know what that is. It‘s propaganda, provocateurs, and all that jazz.”"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/watch-freedom-convoy-demonstrator-canadians-are-tired-of-being-sorry/,"OTTAWA, Ontario – “I’m tired of being sorry,” a demonstrator feeding truckers and others at the Freedom Convoy protest identifying himself as Dave told Breitbart News on Wednesday.Dave, who told Breitbart News he came to Ottawa from Montreal, Quebec, said he had been in the nation’s capital since Friday night. He was volunteering working a makeshift kiosk serving hot coffee and chocolate, tea, soups, and other food and drink provided by donations to trucker demonstrators and other protesters near Parliament Hill.Canadians have a reputation for being excessively conciliatory, Dave stated. He remarked, “We’ve been known worldwide to be too sorry for stuff, and I’m tired of being sorry.”Dave described the atmosphere of the ongoing demonstration.“This is what happens when Canada – coast to coast – gathers in one area,” he shared. “It’s nothing but smiles, good vibes, support love, appreciation, resistance, and freedom.” He added, “We feel like we have a certain responsibility to stick around because so many good vibes came our way. It’s heartwarming to see how we can help [and] how people help us back.”“We came here to show support for this whole protest,” he said when asked for his motivations in coming to Ottawa. He added, “Truckers have led the way, in a phenomenal way. … It’s not a race anymore. … We’re not in race mode, anymore. We’re in marathon mode. The longer you stick around and everything goes smoothly, that’s where you grow something.”Dave said his kiosk was part of building a temporary “community” of likeminded Canadians opposed to varying restrictions imposed across the country marketed by government authorities as “public health” measures. Coffee helps facilitate conversation, he noted.“Coffee is a social thing,” he observed. “So people gather, they grab a cup of coffee, and exchange their ideas.”"

Apologize,” Mayor Watson said Wednesday evening.Ottawa city councillor Catherine McKenney has also called for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to manage the Freedom Convoy demonstration on Parliament Hill and stated, “Residents downtown have been abandoned during a national crisis and an occupation of our city.”As the protests continue, Ottawa police have expressed a desire to end the protests entirely, with Police Chief Peter Sloly suggesting that the city may request aid from the Canadian armed forces to halt the protestor’s activities.As protests continue in Canada’s capital city against vaccine mandates, a poll released Monday reveals that a majority of Canadians now want to end the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic restrictions entirely. https://t.co/I2b9vvN3Ww— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 2, 2022Sloly added that bringing in the military could increase tensions and came with significant risks but admitted the city’s police force did not have the manpower to stop the protest.A spokesman for the Canadian Defence Ministry, meanwhile, responded to the police cheif’s remarks saying, “The Canadian Armed Forces are not involved in law enforcement in this situation, and there are no plans for such CAF involvement.”The local Ottawa government has also discussed taking court action against the fundraising platform GoFundMe, which hosts a fundraiser for the Freedom Convoy that has reached over ten million Canadian dollars but is currently paused for review.Quebec’s Premier signaled that he is willing to meet with the Freedom Convoy, in stark comparison to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who ruled out a meeting with the protesters. https://t.co/8RLi30KsP9— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 3, 2022"

She said she had attended the ongoing rallies since the prior Saturday.“This has gone too far,” she declared. “It’s kind of scary-slash-funny how far they’ve gone up there on parliament. It’s just got to stop. The people have had enough. This is day five. I’ve seen the people. I’ve seen the families. They’ve had it.”Breitbart News invited Shanna’s response to news media characterizations of trucker protesters and their supporters as “white supremacists.”Shanna laughed at the accusation. She invited observers to visit the demonstration to learn about its participants.She urged, “Just come down. Come down any day – even on the weekends or on a weekday – look around. You for sure see Canada here. Everybody is here in unity, and there’s all love.”“I’ve been down here five days trying to find this hate,” she concluded “I can’t find it.” "
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/trump-once-again-praises-d-c-bound-freedom-convoy-protesting-vaccine-mandates/,"Former President Donald Trump showed support for the “freedom convoy” of truckers protesting vaccine mandates for the second time in one week.The former President said in a statement:The Freedom Convoy is peacefully protesting the harsh policies of far left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates. Now, thankfully, the Freedom Convoy could be coming to DC with American Truckers who want to protest Biden’s ridiculous Covid policies.The Freedom Convoy is a Canadian-based group of truckers protesting far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s vaccine mandates. Trudeau began requiring truckers crossing the Canadian border to show proof of vaccination starting January 15.President Joe Biden implemented a similar vaccination requirement for border crossers on January 22.After traveling to Canada’s capital city Ottawa, the Freedom Convoy plans to travel to Washington, DC.Friday’s statement is not the first time Trump showed support for the truckers. At his rally in Texas last weekend, Trump said the truckers were “doing more to defend American freedom than our own leaders by far.”New Jersey State Senator Ed Durr (R), a former trucker who stunned the nation when he defeated longtime Senate president Stephen Sweeney last November, also signaled his support for the truckers during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.“I think their voices definitely need to be heard. I think the only way that people hear things is when you protest,” Durr said.However, big tech is doing everything in their power to silence the truckers’ voices. GoFundMe froze a fundraiser entitled “Freedom Convoy 2022” on Wednesday after the page had raised more than $10 million. Additionally, Facebook deleted a U.S.-based convoy group called “Convoy to D.C. 2022.”“They like to silence people that speak the truth,” said Jeremy Johnson, an organizer of the Facebook page. Johnson also had his personal account removed from the platform.In his statement, Trump called out big tech’s censorship and highlighted his upcoming social media platform, TruthSocial.“Facebook is canceling the accounts of Freedom Convoy USA, and GoFundMe is denying access to funds that belong to the Freedom Convoy,” Trump said. “This is unacceptable and extremely dangerous in any country that values free expression.”“TruthSocial is announcing today that we are welcoming the Freedom Convoy with open arms to communicate freely on TruthSocial when we launch – coming very soon,” Trump added."

Dave traveled to Canada’s capital to help support truckers and other protesters in front of Parliament Hill, pairing up with an elderly lady to sustain the rally’s participants with coffee, hot chocolate, assorted protein bars, soups, sandwiches, and whatever else others donated.Truckers began organizing convoys from Western Canada the week prior in opposition to the federal government’s decree that “unvaccinated” Canadian truck drivers re-entering the country by land subject themselves to a 14-day “quarantine.” “Unvaccinated” foreign truckers are now denied entry to Canada.The atmosphere of the protest on Saturday in downtown Ottawa was cheerful, happy, and infectious. Despite daytime temperatures around -20 Celsius (about -4ºF), Canadians coming together in opposition to human rights violations in the name of “public health” were upbeat.Thousands of people were present on and around Parliament Hill on Wednesday, many flashing big smiles beaming from bare faces. The protesters contrasted starkly with the grim scenes of masked government employees scuttling about the area on a normal weekday.Anti-social distancing was replaced by social closeness. The sea of persons on Wellington Street resembled the thickness of people normally seen on Canada Day, not unlike a busy nightclub or concert in terms of density. Thousands of people were within inches of one another. Walking past someone smoking a cigarette was nerve-wracking when wearing a pricey and bulky winter jacket.Participants were rejecting the doctrine of fearing fellow humans as deliverers of disease.Canadians have a global reputation of being too conciliatory, Dave reflected. He told me, “We’ve been known worldwide to be too sorry for stuff, and I’m tired of being sorry.”News media outlets described a fictional parallel universe divorced from the demonstration’s reality.

Those are the three fundamental [and] sovereign rights that we have as human beings living in Canada, whether you are jabbed or unjabbed, and the government has totally stepped on those rights.”The government’s ongoing restrictions on human freedom are “unconstitutional” and “inhumane,” he added.Mark and Mike — from Manitoba and Alberta, respectively — spoke about freedom as their rationale for driving hundreds of kilometers to Ottawa.“If we don’t defend our freedoms now, our kids will have no freedom to fight for later,” Mark warned. Mike said he was “fed up” and that Canadians “want to be heard.” Trudeau denigrated the demonstrators on Monday as “conspiracy theorists” wearing “tinfoil hats.” Those demonstrating in opposition to the reworking of society in the name of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister added, are unworthy of listening to.“I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect – not just of science – but of the frontline health workers,” Trudeau declared.News media warnings of the threat of “violence” at the Freedom Convoy never came to pass. Ottawa Chief of Police Peter Sloly said on Monday, “Let me repeat, no injuries, no deaths, no riots in the last four days in the nation’s capital, despite the fact that we have a global cause, a national protest tens of thousands of individuals, from a wide variety of causes, who’ve gathered to actively demonstrate 24 hours a day,” he said.Supporters gather near an overpass outside of Toronto in support of a convoy of truckers driving from British Columbia to Ottawa in protest of the Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions on January 27, 2022.

Those are the three fundamental [and] sovereign rights that we have as human beings living in Canada, whether you are jabbed or unjabbed, and the government has totally stepped on those rights.”The government’s ongoing restrictions on human freedom are “unconstitutional” and “inhumane,” he added.Mark and Mike — from Manitoba and Alberta, respectively — spoke about freedom as their rationale for driving hundreds of kilometers to Ottawa.“If we don’t defend our freedoms now, our kids will have no freedom to fight for later,” Mark warned. Mike said he was “fed up” and that Canadians “want to be heard.” Trudeau denigrated the demonstrators on Monday as “conspiracy theorists” wearing “tinfoil hats.” Those demonstrating in opposition to the reworking of society in the name of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister added, are unworthy of listening to.“I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens, and a disrespect – not just of science – but of the frontline health workers,” Trudeau declared.News media warnings of the threat of “violence” at the Freedom Convoy never came to pass. Ottawa Chief of Police Peter Sloly said on Monday, “Let me repeat, no injuries, no deaths, no riots in the last four days in the nation’s capital, despite the fact that we have a global cause, a national protest tens of thousands of individuals, from a wide variety of causes, who’ve gathered to actively demonstrate 24 hours a day,” he said.Supporters gather near an overpass outside of Toronto in support of a convoy of truckers driving from British Columbia to Ottawa in protest of the Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions on January 27, 2022.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/exclusive-freedom-convoy-leader-fake-news-hoax-hate-not-affecting-movement-at-all/,"Freedom Convoy Canada leader and spokesman B.J. Dichter told Breitbart News that establishment media outlets and politicians maligning the trucker movement as “racist,” “white supremacist,” and desecrating war memorials are spewing “fake news hoax hate” that does not affect the movement “at all.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said of the anti-mandate protesters “We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless. We won’t give in to those who fly racist flags. We won’t cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.”Trucks parked in downtown Ottawa, Canada, continue to protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions, on February 4, 2022. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)But when Dichter hears the claims, which are parroted by the establishment media, he says, “I laugh, and I make fun of him, and I post memes. It’s fake news hoax hate. I mean that’s all it is, right? He’s a moron.”“Who do you trust if you’re the average person?” he asked. “Do you trust your average, working class person who has zero political ambitions, or do you trust a politician?”Comparing the United States to Canada, Dichter said, “Both of us have a mascot in power who is not making any of the decisions, but is authoritarian by nature, and there’s a group of weasels behind them.”“Justin Trudeau has no idea what’s going on,” he told Breitbart News. “They keep him completely isolated. He doesn’t read the media, he doesn’t participate in anything political, because he always hated politics – wanted nothing to do with it. It was his wife’s family, and it was the party that wanted his name to get elected. He’s not making any decisions.”“Well, I don’t think dementia-ridden Joe Biden is making any decisions, either,” he continued. “They just wheel him out to be Joe Biden, you know, to choke on some soup, say something stupid, and then everybody behind the scenes are the ones who are running the show. So both countries are in the same predicament right now.”Supporters arrive at Parliament Hill for the Freedom Truck Convoy in Ottawa, Canada, on January 29, 2022. (LARS HAGBERG/AFP via Getty Images)When asked how Canadians view establishment media outlets, Dichter told Breitbart News, “I think people are increasingly skeptical of what they’re being told in the media, because, you know, they keep doubling down on this ‘don’t believe your lying eyes’ strategy.”“People can see very clearly that none of that is happening, especially here in Ottawa,” he continued. “They see that, you know, they set up a soup kitchen for the homeless here, that they were feeding them. I’m not sure how that becomes violent people.”Dichter went on to describe how he called out the establishment media when they reported about truckers desecrating war memorials and partaking in other vandalism.At a speech “to 30-40-50,000 people in minus-30 degrees,” he said, “The fake news got really upset, that’s when they started to try to just smear me and publicly shamed me, because I said on stage, ‘Let me tell you about the fake news.’: today’s fake news story — that day — was that somebody in the trucking convoy parked on the war memorial, and how disrespectful it was.”“But what they omitted was where the trucker parked was the actual parking spot that the media usually parks in when there’s an event,” he explained. “So, I imagined they’re just upset that we took their parking spot, and that’s how they’re lashing out.”“Well then the next day, [the narrative] became, ‘Oh, somebody desecrated the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,'” he continued. “and then two days after that, when that kind of stuck but not really, it became — [after] somebody took a picture of water around on the outskirts of the war memorial — like, ‘Oh, somebody urinated at the war memorial.'”“When they keep changing what the outrage is, you know it’s fake,” he concluded.Supporters gather at Parliament Hill for the Freedom Truck Convoy in Ottawa, Canada, on January 29, 2022. (LARS HAGBERG/AFP via Getty Images)As Breitbart News reported, “Police in Ottawa have stated that they have intelligence that the number of protestors joining the Freedom Convoy to protest vaccine mandates and Wuhan coronavirus restrictions will increase this weekend.”Dichter also told Breitbart News that the relationship between the Freedom Convoy and the Ottawa police is “very positive” based on mutual respect, grounded in military veteran status and Canadian patriotism.Breccan F.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/canadas-conservative-leader-candice-bergen-demands-blackface-trudeau-apologize-for-calling-truckers-racist/,"Candice Bergen, elected on Wednesday to replace the ousted Erin O’Toole as interim leader of the Canadian Conservative caucus, came out swinging in her debut House of Commons appearance by blasting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for refusing to extend an “olive branch” to Freedom Convoy demonstrators. O’Toole was dumped by the Conservatives in a secret ballot and replaced by Bergen (who is not to be confused with the American actress of the same name). The Conservatives felt O’Toole was ineffective as an opposition leader and blamed him for losing a snap election to the Liberals in 2021 – a vote forced by Trudeau that looked like a dangerous miscalculation on his part for a while, given mounting public unhappiness with the state of Canadian affairs under the pandemic.Bergen presented herself as a more pugnacious alternative to O’Toole on Monday when she attacked Trudeau’s hypocrisy for wearing blackface in his school days and demanded that he apologize for dismissing the huge Freedom Convoy anti-mandate movement as a pack of racists.On Thursday, Bergen said she was determined to strengthen the Conservatives and leave the opposition in fighting shape for the next permanent leader, who will be elected in a contest that has yet to be scheduled – the third leadership race in five years.Bergen restated her support for the Freedom Convoy and blasted Trudeau for attempting to slander and ostracize the demonstrators.We all agree we want an end to the protests, and we want an end to the restrictions. We're Canadians, let's find common ground. pic.twitter.com/HpDBe5XkcV— Candice Bergen (@CandiceBergenMP) February 4, 2022“Can the prime minister please tell Canadians what role he thinks the government can play and what they can do to solve the impasse?” she asked from the House of Commons.When Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland responded to Bergen by once again condemning the acts of vandalism from some protesters, Bergen replied: “Maybe all the horns have affected her hearing because I don’t know if she heard my question. Where is the olive branch?”“There is no one in this House who tolerates racism,” Bergen said, chiding Freeland’s remarks as “disappointing” and “classic gaslighting” before reminding the chamber about Trudeau wearing blackface.“About wearing the blackface, et cetera, we do not need to go through the litany of racist things that have been done by people who clearly have very poor judgment,” she said. “But that isn’t what we are talking about. We are talking about an impasse on Parliament Hill. We need to have some solution. There needs to be an olive branch. Where is that?”Canada’s Globe and Mail on Thursday suggested Bergen and the Conservatives are taking a risk by siding so firmly with the Freedom Convoy, which was supported by only about 32 percent of Canadians in recent polls, although its support is much stronger on the Canadian right. However, over half of the respondents in the same poll thought Trudeau handled the protests badly.The Globe and Mail quoted Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller calling Bergen “nuts” for equating vandalism by Freedom Convoy demonstrators with the destruction of monuments by left-wing protesters (which he evidently finds more acceptable) and ominously muttering that Bergen has been seen wearing a Make America Great Again hat."

Dichter told Breitbart News that he believes Ottawa police “have no intention of interfering” with the peaceful protests, despite the Ottawa city leadership declaring a “surge and contain strategy” on protesters.“The city government in Ottawa doesn’t know what to do with us because the police have no intention, despite what they’re trying to say, the police have no intention of interfering,” he said. “The police are looking at this now as something that needs a political solution.”Ottawa police officials announced Friday they would be “implementing a surge and contain strategy in Ottawa’s downtown neighbourhoods to further protect neighbourhoods, restore order and prevent unlawful activity.” But Dichter believes this declaration may be fruitless.“I think what you’re seeing is the city councilors, which in Ottawa are primarily communists — and the only thing communists know is to get violent and double down — they can spill the rhetoric as much as they want,” he said. “But I don’t think that we’ll police services to feed those demands.”Dichter told Breitbart News that the reason they will not interfere is out of a mutual respect, grounded in military veteran status and Canadian patriotism.Supporters of the Freedom Convoy protest vaccine mandates and restrictions on January 29, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)“The reason the police have been so accommodating towards us is because a lot of these truckers, they’re either veterans themselves, or they come from veteran families,” he explained, referencing establishment media reports that some protesters were desecrating war memorials and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Ottawa. “So, whether it was true or not, they [the truckers] were really upset to hear it. So what did they do? They went and got some shovels, shoveled a lot of the snowbanks away, cleared off the area, and cleaned it up.”“They found some litter and trash and they cleaned that all up, bought a whole bunch of flowers decorated the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,” he continued, “and then they posted veterans that are part of the trucking convoy as protection to the war memorial — and then they started doing it by shift. So, according to the media, we are hateful to the war memorial.”Describing the truckers’ relationship with the police as “very positive,” Dichter said, “They are shocked with how peaceful everything has been.”“There’s not been any issues aside from people unaffiliated with with the rally — and that’s going to happen anywhere — but they haven’t had any problems,” he said. “They’re are shocked at how much we’ve been cleaning up the city, and organizing things, and feeding the homeless like all that good – just being a decent human being.”“And that’s why everybody’s, you know, every night they go out dancing, and people are meeting each other, forming new friendships, and the police see that,” he explained. “And they’re like, ‘Yeah, this is not something that we’re going to intervene with. We don’t have any interest. There’s no reason for us to escalate it.’”Very volatile and very dangerous. pic.twitter.com/xKrQ5sFNJh https://t.co/p2DhoihnG7— Marie Oakes (@TheMarieOakes) February 4, 2022Commenting on how politicians in Ottawa — including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who fled the city in light of the truckers coming in — have been speaking about the truckers negatively, Dichter simply said, “Who’s more patriotic towards Canada: the right wing truckers who served in the military, or Justin Trudeau? Somebody who has disturbing opinions about communism. You tell me who is the patriot when it comes to Canada.”Overall, Dichter described the scene in Ottawa as “amazing” and “so much fun.

I’ve never been more proud to be Canadian.”Another trucker, Travis of New Brunswick, spoke regarding the outpouring of assistance. “There’s people knocking on my door every five minutes wanting to give,” he told Fox News. “There has been nothing but caring, sharing and giving.” “Do you see how caring these people are? That’s Canada. That is Canada. Let us be Canada again,” Travis explained. Andrew, a third trucker, detailed that supporters offer him money, but he refuses.“I’m not doing this to make money. I’m doing this for the choice, for everybody’s choice, for freedoms,” he said. Breitbart News’s Robert Kraychik spoke with one man named Dave, who is supporting the Freedom Convoy.

There’s no such thing as them sitting still, making money.”“And if our federal government had any guts, they’d put the GoFundMe executives in jail for what they’re doing to them,” Collins added. “That’s highway robbery.”Listen Below:Collins and Boyle were discussing the U.S. trucker convoy — inspired by the Canadian trucker convoy — that is currently being organized to protest against vaccine mandates.The U.S. trucker convoy was also censored by Facebook earlier this week, to which Collins reacted by saying, “It just goes to show how much control that social media and these media platforms have gotten, to where they think they can rule over everything that goes on in America.”“It’s time to break up a lot of these mega media giants out there,” the congressional candidate added.Collins also noted that the trucking industry “for decades,” has “been pummeled with regulations and taxes — it’s an industry that has been battered and beat down.”“And then you throw in a pandemic that happened for well over a year, where not only was there nowhere to get food through truck stops — rest areas were closed down — but you had shippers and consignees that were scared to death. You might drive up, and they might be closed,” he added.“It was just a very, very hard situation for drivers, and they’re out there, and they know how important their job is — they are the backbone of this country,” Collins affirmed. “They were out there, even as their families were at home, scared, and they were scared — we all were.”The congressional candidate went on to say freedom is nonetheless still important to people, which is why a vaccine mandate “is just the final straw,” prompting protests among truckers in Canada, and soon, the United States.“And it’s not just standing up for the trucking industry’s rights, but this is for American rights, the Canadian, the average person’s rights,” Collins said.“These are not your Ivy League grads, and your elite celebrities out there, or your politicians that everybody knows,” he added. “This is just average, everyday, ordinary, blue collar people, and I think that’s what makes it probably more special than anything.”After being asked what his message is to the truckers across America who are organizing their own freedom convoy, Collins said, “I guarantee you people will join in.”“It’s time for us to take our country back, and we’re doing it with everyday, ordinary people,” he said. “We’re not doing it with the big celebs and all that, and that’s what makes this shine so bright.”Collins is currently leading big in a crowded field of contenders hoping to replace Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), according to a recent Trafalgar Group poll. The poll shows Collins with 35.6 percent, followed by former Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) with 11.1 percent.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram."

https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2022/02/06/bokhari-joe-rogan-apologized-and-the-mob-pounced/,"The progressive establishment is determined to cancel Joe Rogan, for obvious reasons: because he’s popular, more popular than any other media figure in the U.S. who comments on current events, and he’s not on their team.In response, Rogan is making a classic error — assuming the torrent of hate he’s facing comes from a place of good faith, and that he can make it go away by addressing the mob’s concerns, apologizing, and pledging to do better.Rogan has released more than 1,700 episodes of his podcast over the years. Each one has been a live discussion, usually running three hours or more, without editing or filtering.Screenshot/YouTube/PowerfulJREIt is almost certain that over the course of those episodes, which add up to over 5,000 hours of live, unfiltered footage, Rogan will have said things that he regrets, or wishes he’d said better; things that he genuinely believes merit an apology.But that’s not what the mob really cares about. Like Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones and other people the mob has tried to cancel, Rogan is considered a threat to the progressive world order.His podcast episodes draw an audience of roughly 11 million people, an audience four times the size of the most popular cable news host, giving him enormous influence over national political issues. In the eyes of the mob, that is his true crime, and that is why they want him gone.It started with Rogan’s discussion with Dr. Robert Malone, who conducted early research on mRNA technology and opposes their use in coronavirus vaccines.Rogan apologized for that episode, promising to do more research ahead of future controversial discussions, and to invite experts with competing opinions on the show.The mob didn’t care, because it was never about one episode, it was about the podcast’s influence over public opinion, an influence that lies beyond their control. The Malone episode’s impact on the public debate – instantly turning the phrase “mass formation psychosis” into a meme – simply highlighted Rogan’s influence, and danger to the progressive worldview.Thus galvanized, the mob instantly formed.Now formed, the mob will not dissipate until Rogan is banished from every major platform, or until a line in the sand is drawn across which they know they cannot cross.As if to prove it was never really about the Malone episode, the mob has now cut together a clip of Joe Rogan saying the N-word in various episodes.Rogan once again released an apology video, calling it the “most regretful and shameful thing I have ever had to talk about publicly.”(Instagram / @joerogan)“To most people, there is no context where a white person is ever allowed to say that word, nevermind publicly on a podcast… It’s not my word to use,” said Rogan.The people attacking Joe Rogan don’t actually care about him using the N-word.These are the same people who ignored the racist assault of Larry Elder, which included a white woman dressed in a gorilla mask, chasing the then-candidate for CA governor.It’s the same people who defended Joe Biden for telling black voters “you ain’t black” if they didn’t vote for him.These are the same people falsely accusing the Canadian Freedom Convoy of harboring racists and neo-confederates, while ignoring the extraordinary number of times Justin Trudeau has worn blackface.They don’t care about clips of The Young Turks saying the same thing Rogan did, and they don’t care about Joe Biden saying it either.What Joe Rogan did is totally unacceptable pic.twitter.com/JvkHOMQQdD— Luke Rudkowski (@Lukewearechange) February 5, 2022If you actually think that finding old clips of someone using the n-word is proof they're a racist, then you would find this 👇 infinitely more alarming and important given that he is kind of more powerful than Joe Rogan. But you don't think that: it's just a game to silence him. pic.twitter.com/xLBjgOsjgw— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 5, 2022Apologies give momentum to the mob, convincing them they are making progress in their goal to cancel, censor and ban their target. It convinces them to stick around longer, and convinces more censorship-minded people that now is the moment to join the bandwagon.In over 5,000 hours of footage, Joe Rogan has almost certainly said some ill-advised things that he feels are worth apologizing for.But he should wait for the mob to go home first.Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News. He is the author of #DELETED: Big Tech’s Battle to Erase the Trump Movement and Steal The Election. "

He emphasized that they “have been through hell.”He stated, “It’s disturbing when you see the protest turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival, where they’ve got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows great deal of insensitivity.”Breitbart News recorded video of a bouncy castle with playing children on Saturday. Dozens of children were observed with parents attending the demonstration on and around Wellington Street adjacent Canada’s federal legislature.CBC, the left-wing state-funded broadcaster, reported on the presence of saunas and bouncy castles at the protest.“They shouldn’t be bringing in hot tubs, and they shouldn’t be bringing bouncy castles,” Watson repeated. “That’s just ridiculous.

It reported, “After nearly 40 years, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has officially come out as gay.” Watson wrote a column in the same year titled “Mayor Jim Watson: After 40 years, I’m opening the closet door.”Katie Griffin, the CTV anchor, invited Watson to call for military suppression of the protest by repeating Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly’s claim that local police have insufficient resources to fulfill their duties. She claimed people are “losing faith in the city’s ability to [restore] some sort of order.”She asked, “What options do we have right now? Are you at the point where you have to request the military to come in?”Watson used military terminology in describing the nation’s capital as “under siege” by the Freedom Convoy.The mayor said local law enforcement is using traffic tickets as a tool to end the Freedom Convoy protest. “We started to see the police issue significantly more tickets, traffic tickets as well as Highway Traffic Act tickets. That has to be done, it hits them ni the pocketbook.”Government must block fundraising for the Freedom Convoy truckers and supporters, he said, referring to GoFundMe’s freezing of funds raised by the “Freedom Convoy 2022” campaign. Breitbart News reported on GoFundMe’s eventual return of the funds to original donors following a reversal on its stated intention to seize and redistribute the money to “charities” of its choosing.Watson said money for the Freedom Convoy crowdsourced through digital fundraisers should be “cut off.”“We negotiated with GoFundMe, where that service rejected the protesters and [is] sending the money back to the individuals, so that hopefully will help, although I know there are other services that are going to try to help, and we’ll go back to them, and try to get that money cut off, because that’s one the ways of trying to bring this to an end, financially.”He concluded by warning that the demonstration in Ottawa is “now spreading across the country.” "

It caused deaths. It caused, I think, about a half a billion dollars worth of destruction in these cities. So, they are very subjective, and I will say this — it is why we need some non-discrimination language that will be in the governments and the legislation that we are going to pass dealing with these big tech companies.”She continued, “They are very subjective in what they monitor, what they censor, how they carry this out. And the actions they have taken against the Freedom Convoy are very discriminatory. They disagree with them, so, therefore, they were going to cut them off, which they did, and then they were going to take the $9 million and use it for charities or groups or something — people that were on their GoFundMe site. Now, fortunately, they are giving the money back, and the money is going to the Freedom Convoy through other avenues. But … this is why we have to go in, and we have to deal with the big tech companies, these social media platforms, and the way they are conducting themselves in the virtual space.”Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"

It also provides greater flexibility within the municipal administration to enable the City of Ottawa to manage business continuity for essential services for its residents and enables a more flexible procurement process, which could help purchase equipment required by frontline workers and first responders.The Ottawa police simultaneously issued a statement on Sunday, accusing the protesters in downtown Ottawa of exhibiting disruptive and unlawful behavior.IMPORTANT: Anyone attempting to bring material supports (gas, etc.) to the demonstrators could be subject to arrest.

Breitbart News invited her response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s repeated denigration of Canadians opposed to his policies as engaging in “racist, misogynistic attacks.”Wendy said, “I’ve been saying for a bit – almost jokingly – for Trudeau to come and say these things to our face, and I heard a couple of truckers say that. Trudeau, we want you to come and talk to us. You owe us that. You’re our leader, and you need to come and figure it out. You need to talk to us and you need to address the people that are here to see you.”“There’s so many emotions, right now,” she added. “The things that Trudeau was saying really fires me up. We’re not misogynists. We’re not racists. We’re not bigots. How dare he say that.”“This is the one of the most peaceful, loving movements I’ve ever been to in my entire life,” Wendy said of the protest’s atmosphere. “There is not one person that is motivated by anything other than love.”A supporter shakes the hand of a trucker as a convoy of truckers arrives at a police blockade on February 5, 2022, in Toronto, Canada (Cole Burston/Getty Images).Political denigration of the protesters as bigots amounts to “projection,” she held.“Projection is what’s going on with Trudeau and his government,” she stated. “Telling us that we are violent is absolutely ridiculous, because all that one has to do is look around to know that we are actually motivated by love, not fear, and we dare you, Trudeau, to come and speak to us to our faces.

Whether they’re vaxxed or unvaxxed, people are saying, ‘Enough.'”Levant responded to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau frequent denigrations of his political detractors as bigots.“‘When Trudeau says, ‘Oh, those truckers are just racists,’ it’s laughable,” Levant remarked, “because so many of them are visible minorities, new Canadians, whatever — and that’s an other thing — the normal weapons that work against the Conservative Party in Canada — ‘you’re racist, you’re transphobic, you’re alt-right’ — they seem to be bouncing off this convoy, partly because it’s so ethnically diverse, but mainly because literally one million Canadians have some first-hand experience with it. They saw it. They cheered it. They were in it, [or] they know someone who was, so it’s a tremendous clash of two narratives.”Canadians are rejecting derisions of the trucker convoy demonstrations across the country as “racist,” Levant observed. He said there is “too much information” demonstrating the reality of the demonstrators’ conduct and philosophy for news media and politicians to overcome with dishonest narratives.A sign of the times on the streets of Vancouver (Ethan Letkeman/Breitbart News)Levant stated, “This Trudeau narrative and the Media Party repeaters saying, ‘Oh, they’re just racist, sexist, January-6-Trump crazies, [and] were violent.’ That’s a very powerful message when it’s magnified by every mainstream media organization. But when you have a million people who saw things with their own eyes, and who see the videos of the Sikh truckers dancing the Bhangra, or the cowboys on horseback, there’s too much information that’s coming first-hand for the typical spears to work.”Time’s up: A message for the legacy media in Vancouver (Ethan Letkeman/Breitbart News)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently characterized trucker protesters and supportive demonstrators as “conspiracy theorist” wearers of “tinfoil hats.”He previously denigrated Canadian citizens politically opposed to him, sneering at members of “anti-vaxxer mobs” who are “racist,” “misogynistic,” and “don’t believe in science.”Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern."

They also need to know what plans were in place to deal with any further health emergencies.“We are asking the provincial government and public health authorities to share a plan, like other provinces have done, so we can tell congresses, visitors and tourists: ‘Here is a plan for how you can come to Montreal this spring and this summer,’” Plante said.“There has to be a plan. What is the plan for the measures for the spring and for the summer? People are booking … flights right now,” she noted.“The Quebec government has been helpful during the COVID waves, but we are asking them not to forget smaller venues, smaller events that fully contribute to the dynamism and economic growth of Montreal,” she said.“Montreal is a dynamic and vibrant city, but it is perceived now as closed — without plans for its reopening,” warned Tourisme Montreal president Yves Lalumiere, joining Plante’s press conference by video link.“I think our reputation as an open city, a very international city with record-breaking numbers of visitors, is at risk as other cities have reopened and made clear statements,” Lalumiere cautioned.Tourism industry representatives told Canada’s Global News they feared travelers might bypass Montreal and look to other cities that have faster and more specific reopening plans.“We were the first to shut down and we are now the last ones to reopen,” complained Glenn Castanheira of Montreal Centre-Ville, the city’s downtown business, and tourism area.“We’ve managed to postpone some of the stuff that we had booked for January, February and December, but we’ve lost a lot of shows straight up because artists are just fed up with rescheduling,” said the head of a Montreal booking agency. As recently as late January, Quebec health officials resisted calls to publish a firm reopening calendar. They said one reason they hesitated was to see whether the elementary and high school reopenings authorized on January 17 caused a surge in coronavirus cases."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/07/exclusive-freedom-convoy-leader-this-is-the-only-true-opposition-to-communist-liberals-and-socialist-conservatives/,"Canadians have suffered with a political “uni-party” with no true opposition for too long, Freedom Convoy leader and spokesman B.J. Dichter told Breitbart News.Explaining that the “uni-party” in Parliament has become a coalition of “communist Liberals” and “socialist Conservatives” working in tandem to effectuate authoritarian coronavirus mandates, Dichter said that the Freedom Convoy represents the only true opposition, which is rooted in the will of the Canadian people.“The reason we are now out-fundraising any political party in Canada’s history is because people don’t have a vote, but you know, they can vote with their money,” he explained. “And they can say, ‘These guys on the other side, hard-working Canadians in the trucking industry, they’re speaking up for us — that’s the opposition.’ They’re giving us money not because they think we need all of this money for the truckers; they just want a voice, and that’s become the voice.”The Freedom Convoy movement has proliferated to many cities and towns in Canada, defined by a large presence of peaceful protesters and trucks that symbolize the working class. Over the weekend, however, Ottawa — the central protest location — has seen its police crack down on protesters, declaring a “state of emergency.”Videos of supply confiscations emerged, and Ottawa police warned that “anyone attempting to bring material supports (gas, etc.) to the demonstrators could be subject to arrest. Enforcement is underway.”Ottawa police have removed all fuel and propane from Freedom Convoy truck parking lot pic.twitter.com/oJDaceHHlo— Marie Oakes (@TheMarieOakes) February 7, 2022Describing the Ottawa city council as “communist,” Dichter told Breitbart news that “the only thing communists know is to get violent and double down.”The authoritarianism for Dichter and many Canadians does not just exist among Liberal Party politicians, he explained, it is also boosted by the Tories who have gone along with the mandates.“Let’s not just lay the blame solely at the feet of Justin Trudeau,” he said. “And that’s why [former Conservative Leader of the Opposition] Erin O’Toole was such a failure as leader, because he was chasing Justin Trudeau off the communist cliff, like both of them are farther left than [former Prime Minister] Jean Chrétien.”O’Toole was ousted as Conservative leader toward the beginning of the convoy, after just 18 months in leadership, and replaced with Candice Bergen as interim leader.The political class in Ottawa is not the only place where Conservative leadership has capitulated to authoritarian rule, Dichter told Breitbart News, explaining that provincial premiers are “trying to play it both ways.”“The premiers who have done these extreme lockdowns have been: [Ontario Premier] Doug Ford, Conservative; [Alberta Premier] Jason Kenney, Conservative; [Nova Scotia Premier] Tim Houston, Conservative; [Saskatchewan Premier] Scott Moe, Conservative,” he said. “So let’s not play this game that, ‘Oh, it’s only the Liberals and it’s not the Conservatives.’ No. It’s the political class that needs to be purged of this garbage.”“Unfortunately, the political class we have now doesn’t make decisions. They just look at polls. That’s all they do,” Dichter continued. “It’s frustrating that none of them will use their moral skill to make decisions.”“Jason Kenney is a perfect example of that,” he explained in response to some premiers toying with the idea of reducing or even cancelling the mandates. “So they [the political class] see that we’ve managed to shift public perception almost 40 percent in a week. So they’re scared, they know they got to do something. But they haven’t gotten all the polls, they need to tell them which message they need to say.”“So in the case of Kenney in Alberta, I think you can see why Kenney has been hated from the very day he weaseled his way into leadership of the UCP party, and then ultimately as Premier,” he continued. “Many people have told me, since he got in office, he’s the best of two evils. … They never would have anticipated the degree of lockdowns and restrictions that Kenney brought in.”As another example, Dichter said, “[Quebec Premier François] Legault, who is a Conservative by the way, a populist conservative, has been to the point of Mussolini — like really crazy restrictions on people like absolutely unacceptable in any sort of liberal democracy.”When asked how Canada was able to become so authoritarian in his eyes, Dichter pointed to two political realities.“Canadians are somewhat passive,” he said, relative to their American neighbors. “We’re not confrontational until things get really bad or we’re in a hockey rink.”“But there comes a point where Canadians get pushed too far,” Dichter continued. “Just so happens that our line is a lot farther than Americans. It’s just the difference of culture between our two countries, right? And it’s not about one’s better than the other, it’s just two different approaches.”The other political reality is geographical.“Remember how spread out Canada is,” he explained noting a large dichotomy between cities and rural areas and their propensity to follow government mandates. “It’s larger in landmass than the United States, but it has ten percent of the population. You can be in a province that has heavy restrictions, according to the government, but you’d be in rural Ontario, and we get the most draconian lockdown measures, and nobody there is going to pay attention to it.”“Everybody’s just gonna ignore it,” he asserted. “They’re strong people, they don’t care what the government says — they’re going to think the government is lying to them anyway.”But a breaking point came, especially for truckers, and Canadians across the country joined in to fight back.“It clearly started with truckers and has expanded beyond that,” Dichter told Breitbart News. “I think what you’re seeing in all the videos across the country, you know, those people standing on the side of the road with their families and the kids waving by truckers, those people aren’t truckers, but they’re people who don’t have a voice, and that’s what this is about.”“So yeah, it started with truckers because they have, you know, the symbolism of a truck of being working class having a large presence,” he continued. “So it really is an imposing feeling against the people in a major urban center where these people — you know how the urban elites, they have this worldview, in urban centers, and they have this worldview towards rural communities. And, you know, New York is the same way: a little bit smug and look down upon the working class and rural communities. But now they have no choice. They can’t ignore them because there are 20,000 pound rigs parked right in front of their apartment buildings.”To Dichter, their demands of the government are “pretty simple” and remain the same.“Our demands are we want to remove the mandates by the government; the lack of freedom of choice,” he said. “And we want the digital Passport System abolished that we know, in our mind, is a slippery slope toward authoritarianism and social credit.”Breccan F.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/06/blackburn-gofundmes-actions-against-freedom-convoy-discriminatory/,"Sunday on FNC’s “Fox Report,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) reacted to GoFundMe’s decision to redirect money sent to the Canadian Freedom Convoy to causes the donors never intended.GoFundMe has since relented to public backlash and refunded the cause’s donors.Blackburn argued GoFundMe’s initial action against the Freedom Convoy was “discriminatory.” She added the tech company’s practices are why social media platforms need to be reined in.“[I]f you use their actions and say that’s their logic and they are saying, ‘Well, you cannot have this on our site because it causes a disruption.’ Well then, you would think they would be pulling down every BLM organization or affiliated organization, but that is not what is happening,” said Blackburn. “And we know that GoFundMe corporately gave to BLM when those protests were taking place, and the violence was carried out in cities. It caused deaths. It caused, I think, about a half a billion dollars worth of destruction in these cities. So, they are very subjective, and I will say this — it is why we need some non-discrimination language that will be in the governments and the legislation that we are going to pass dealing with these big tech companies.”She continued, “They are very subjective in what they monitor, what they censor, how they carry this out. And the actions they have taken against the Freedom Convoy are very discriminatory. They disagree with them, so, therefore, they were going to cut them off, which they did, and then they were going to take the $9 million and use it for charities or groups or something — people that were on their GoFundMe site. Now, fortunately, they are giving the money back, and the money is going to the Freedom Convoy through other avenues. But … this is why we have to go in, and we have to deal with the big tech companies, these social media platforms, and the way they are conducting themselves in the virtual space.”Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/06/childless-ottawa-mayor-disturbing-to-see-kids-in-bouncy-castles-having-fun-at-protest/,"Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson described the presence of children playing in bouncy castles at the Freedom Convoy demonstration as “disturbing” in a video interview with CTV News on Sunday.Watson is 60, unmarried, and without children.Ottawa residents living near the demonstration on Parliament Hill and nearby downtown areas are enduring “a living hell,” Watson claims. He emphasized that they “have been through hell.”He stated, “It’s disturbing when you see the protest turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival, where they’ve got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows great deal of insensitivity.”Breitbart News recorded video of a bouncy castle with playing children on Saturday. Dozens of children were observed with parents attending the demonstration on and around Wellington Street adjacent Canada’s federal legislature.CBC, the left-wing state-funded broadcaster, reported on the presence of saunas and bouncy castles at the protest.“They shouldn’t be bringing in hot tubs, and they shouldn’t be bringing bouncy castles,” Watson repeated. “That’s just ridiculous. That should have been stopped.”Bouncy castles have been set up for the kids in Ottawa.

It reported, “After nearly 40 years, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has officially come out as gay.” Watson wrote a column in the same year titled “Mayor Jim Watson: After 40 years, I’m opening the closet door.”Katie Griffin, the CTV anchor, invited Watson to call for military suppression of the protest by repeating Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly’s claim that local police have insufficient resources to fulfill their duties. She claimed people are “losing faith in the city’s ability to [restore] some sort of order.”She asked, “What options do we have right now? Are you at the point where you have to request the military to come in?”Watson used military terminology in describing the nation’s capital as “under siege” by the Freedom Convoy.The mayor said local law enforcement is using traffic tickets as a tool to end the Freedom Convoy protest. “We started to see the police issue significantly more tickets, traffic tickets as well as Highway Traffic Act tickets. That has to be done, it hits them ni the pocketbook.”Government must block fundraising for the Freedom Convoy truckers and supporters, he said, referring to GoFundMe’s freezing of funds raised by the “Freedom Convoy 2022” campaign. Breitbart News reported on GoFundMe’s eventual return of the funds to original donors following a reversal on its stated intention to seize and redistribute the money to “charities” of its choosing.Watson said money for the Freedom Convoy crowdsourced through digital fundraisers should be “cut off.”“We negotiated with GoFundMe, where that service rejected the protesters and [is] sending the money back to the individuals, so that hopefully will help, although I know there are other services that are going to try to help, and we’ll go back to them, and try to get that money cut off, because that’s one the ways of trying to bring this to an end, financially.”He concluded by warning that the demonstration in Ottawa is “now spreading across the country.” "
https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2022/02/07/canadian-veteran-didnt-serve-bullied-chicken-pm/,"Darryl, a Canadian military veteran, told Breitbart News on Saturday in Ottawa, ON, that he did not serve his country to be mistreated by a prime minister fleeing his own people.“I didn’t serve this country to be bullied by a prime minister that ran away like a chicken,” Darryl, a retired corporal from the Canadian Army who served in Afghanistan, said while supporting the Freedom Convoy demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario.Darryl, holding a Canadian flag and wearing a military uniform, warned of Canada’s global reputation being undermined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau avoiding the thousands of Canadians gathered on and around Parliament Hill. The ongoing protest is a coalescence of Canadians opposed to varying government decrees — marketed as health and safety measures to prevent coronavirus transmission — restricting constitutional freedoms.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a news conference on the Covid-19 situation, January 12, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada. (Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)He asked, “Who runs away from their people? It’s insane. If I was in the army right now, I’d be contemplating leaving just because our leadership, our military, our country, will have no credibility because of him — none whatsoever — and that’s sad because Canada is known across the world for the credibility of their military and their people.”Trudeau left the prime minister’s official residence last week for an undisclosed location ahead of the Freedom Convoy’s arrival in the nation’s capital, claiming security concerns. He then said he tested “positive” for COVID-19. His latest official and publicly disclosed itinerary as of Monday indicates he is in the National Capital Region and it lists only “private meetings.”"

The police announced they would not allow truckers to block the main streets of the province’s capital city, a dozen fines were handed out, and the truckers largely dispersed on Sunday – although event organizers called on the truckers to return in two weeks.Quebec was already scheduled to begin lifting some of its pandemic restrictions on Monday, including limited reopening for theaters, public events, and places of worship.

Breitbart News invited her response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s repeated denigration of Canadians opposed to his policies as engaging in “racist, misogynistic attacks.”Wendy said, “I’ve been saying for a bit – almost jokingly – for Trudeau to come and say these things to our face, and I heard a couple of truckers say that. Trudeau, we want you to come and talk to us. You owe us that. You’re our leader, and you need to come and figure it out. You need to talk to us and you need to address the people that are here to see you.”“There’s so many emotions, right now,” she added. “The things that Trudeau was saying really fires me up. We’re not misogynists. We’re not racists. We’re not bigots. How dare he say that.”“This is the one of the most peaceful, loving movements I’ve ever been to in my entire life,” Wendy said of the protest’s atmosphere. “There is not one person that is motivated by anything other than love.”A supporter shakes the hand of a trucker as a convoy of truckers arrives at a police blockade on February 5, 2022, in Toronto, Canada (Cole Burston/Getty Images).Political denigration of the protesters as bigots amounts to “projection,” she held.“Projection is what’s going on with Trudeau and his government,” she stated. “Telling us that we are violent is absolutely ridiculous, because all that one has to do is look around to know that we are actually motivated by love, not fear, and we dare you, Trudeau, to come and speak to us to our faces.

Whether they’re vaxxed or unvaxxed, people are saying, ‘Enough.'”Levant responded to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau frequent denigrations of his political detractors as bigots.“‘When Trudeau says, ‘Oh, those truckers are just racists,’ it’s laughable,” Levant remarked, “because so many of them are visible minorities, new Canadians, whatever — and that’s an other thing — the normal weapons that work against the Conservative Party in Canada — ‘you’re racist, you’re transphobic, you’re alt-right’ — they seem to be bouncing off this convoy, partly because it’s so ethnically diverse, but mainly because literally one million Canadians have some first-hand experience with it. They saw it. They cheered it. They were in it, [or] they know someone who was, so it’s a tremendous clash of two narratives.”Canadians are rejecting derisions of the trucker convoy demonstrations across the country as “racist,” Levant observed.

The first thing to know about the media is that they’re lazy. They’d rather re-write a government press release than get up from their desk and report from the field — especially when it’s -20° out.So they repeat Trudeau’s lie that the truckers are racist and sexist.…2— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20222. The second thing to know is that in Canada, more than 99% of journalists receive a payment from Justin Trudeau. Here’s the list of the journalists who took Trudeau’s $61 million pre-election pay-off: https://t.co/loGh7YgWqVIt’s more than 99% of working journalists.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20223. There is an illusion of media competition in Canada, but it’s an oligopoly. Postmedia — the largest recipient of Trudeau’s media bail-out — owns every English-language daily newspaper in Canada, except two. And even they just run the same wire copy as their competitors.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20224. And Trudeau’s CBC state broadcaster is larger than all other news media combined. Every non-CBC journalist tailors their work so that, if they’re laid off, they can get hired at the CBC, since it’s “too big to fail”. It’s the last resort.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20225. There used to be some conservative media in Canada, e.g. the National Post. But for years they hired woke leftist underminers. Personnel is policy. A majority of their newsroom signed a letter to fire their star columnist. They’re no better than CBC: https://t.co/fSvGLXn854— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20226.

When I worked at Sun News I learned that the TV part of TV companies was economically unimportant compared to the cell phone and cable side of the business. That’s how the CRTC pressures TV companies. News shows are a rounding error compared to regulatory givings and takings.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20228. These are all structural issues. But an obvious point is the lack of diversity in the news media. I don’t mean race or sex — I mean intellectual and class diversity. The Media Party (as I call it) is politically and culturally homogenous. Urban, woke think-alikes.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20229. They don’t know any truckers or farmers or anyone who works outside or wears a hard hat or a uniform. My favorite tweet from the Globe and Mail was this masterpiece. The reporter covering the working classes thought this was a wrecking ball and got scared. pic.twitter.com/mnKQrBTw2n— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202210. How can this rotting industry — monopolistic; corrupted by government money; regulated by government censors; a political monoculture; infected by woke cancel culture — possibly cover a populist workers rebellion? They are intellectually and structurally incapable of it.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202211. Psychologically, these middle class narcissists (every journalist must be a narcissist to believe the world needs to hear what they have to say) cannot believe that the working classes reject them. They always posed as saviours of the working man. It made them feel better.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202212. So the Toronto Star, with its Marxist Atkinson Principles, calls for martial law against working men. They’re for the mass firing of unvaccinated union members, a violation of collective agreements. They’re in bed with Big Pharma. They don’t use the phrase pro-choice anymore.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202213. My point is, for the media to report what’s really happening out there — 100,000+ truckers across the country; 1M people or more who cheered them along the way — would destroy not only the media’s worldview but their self-image. They just cannot believe their eyes.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202214. The pro-Trudeau pollster Abacus shows that 32% of Canadians see themselves in the trucker convoy. If the truckers were a political party, they would immediately be in first place. This is enormous cognitive dissonance to the Media Party who keep calling it a radical fringe. pic.twitter.com/jQgVqI7KrX— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202215. A reason why the Media Party narrative is failing is that a million people have had first-hand contact with the truckers. The revolution IS being televised, just not on CBC. It’s alive on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. These aren’t “racists”: pic.twitter.com/ymb87CZ18G— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202216. So many institutions have failed during the pandemic — Parliament, the opposition Conservatives, the courts, colleges of physicians and surgeons, police, etc. But the media has failed the most. But because they are immune to most consequences, they haven’t noticed it yet.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202217. They don’t understand why people don’t trust them. Here’s CTV, mad that the convoy they’ve been defaming for two weeks won’t invite them in to a press conference as an honoured guest: https://t.co/2vRNmoZpIb— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202218. The icing on the cake is that CTV is part of the government press gallery that excludes conservative media (like Rebel News) from the Parliament. They voted to protect Trudeau from our questions (but they’re accepting applications from Xinhua): https://t.co/WsgZxkWyZc— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202219. CTV is huge. They’re owned by Bell, the cell phone and cable company, that also owns two NHL teams. Which helps explain why they liked the lockdowns so much — but lobbied for special exemptions for them, but not for your kids’ hockey teams.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202220. CTV seems large to you, but it’s unimportant as a business to Bell, it’s a rounding error. It’s value to Bell is the same reason Jeff Bezos bought Washington Post or Carlos Slim bought NY Times: it’s a way to influence government. It’s a lobby group. Your mind is the product.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202221. Even if there were an independent journalist at CTV, they wouldn’t be able to contradict the corporate objectives of Bell. The Globe is owned by the Woodbridge Company. Postmedia is owned by New Jersey’s Chatham Asset Management. They’re all political toys of billionaires.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202222. I have to go to work now (I’m not some government journalist like those at Trudeau’s CBC state broadcaster, or the 99% of Canadian reporters whose paycheque is directly subsidized by Trudeau). But let me leave you with this delicious moment…— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202223. We had reporters at NINE different trucker convoys on the weekend. We’re embedded at the border in Coutts. We’ve got half a dozen people in Ottawa (on the street, not safely tucked away in offices). So people choose our news over the Media Party’s punditry.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202224. The whole world is riveted by what’s happening in Canada. But who can they talk to about what’s really happening? They could call the CBC, and I’m sure CNN does. But that’s just Trudeau’s point of view, it’s not really telling you what’s happening. So they call us.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202225. Yesterday alone our team must have done ten foreign interviews. I was on Tucker Carlson; our young reporter @lincolnmjay was on Hannity (I'll have to find that clip). Those two shows are, what, 8 million views? pic.twitter.com/9S0lnpjLJS— Ezra Levant  (@ezralevant) February 8, 202226. So what's a government journalist to do? Here's the CBC, reduced to tweeting about our reporter appearing on Fox.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/07/canadian-veteran-didnt-serve-bullied-chicken-pm/,"Darryl, a Canadian military veteran, told Breitbart News on Saturday in Ottawa, ON, that he did not serve his country to be mistreated by a prime minister fleeing his own people.“I didn’t serve this country to be bullied by a prime minister that ran away like a chicken,” Darryl, a retired corporal from the Canadian Army who served in Afghanistan, said while supporting the Freedom Convoy demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario.Darryl, holding a Canadian flag and wearing a military uniform, warned of Canada’s global reputation being undermined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau avoiding the thousands of Canadians gathered on and around Parliament Hill. The ongoing protest is a coalescence of Canadians opposed to varying government decrees — marketed as health and safety measures to prevent coronavirus transmission — restricting constitutional freedoms.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a news conference on the Covid-19 situation, January 12, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada. (Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)He asked, “Who runs away from their people? It’s insane. If I was in the army right now, I’d be contemplating leaving just because our leadership, our military, our country, will have no credibility because of him — none whatsoever — and that’s sad because Canada is known across the world for the credibility of their military and their people.”Trudeau left the prime minister’s official residence last week for an undisclosed location ahead of the Freedom Convoy’s arrival in the nation’s capital, claiming security concerns. He then said he tested “positive” for COVID-19. His latest official and publicly disclosed itinerary as of Monday indicates he is in the National Capital Region and it lists only “private meetings.”"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/07/ottawa-demonstrator-corporate-media-alternate-reality/,"Nicholas, a demonstrator supporting the Freedom Convoy in Ottawa, ON, told Breitbart News on Saturday that “corporate media” present an “alternative reality” of protesters in the nation’s capital opposing ongoing government decrees marketed as health as safety measures related to COVID-19.“The reason I’m out here is because I see a lot of the stuff on social media, and then we see obviously an alternative reality on the corporate media. I had to come see it for myself,” Nicholas shared while holding a Canadian flag on Parliament Hill.He described the atmosphere of the demonstration as happy.Protesters of the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walk near Parliament Hill on February 5, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada.

(Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)He said, “I don’t think it could have been anything better than what I’ve seen. It was better than what any other social media has showed me. I saw bouncy castles with kids in it. I saw hay bales. There’s hockey games going on over there. People are feeding each other. I don’t think I’ve seen a happier group of people. I’ve seen somebody walking their Chihuahua around.”“It doesn’t look like the violent protests that people are trying to paint it to be,” he added, referring to news media warnings of the protesters becoming violent. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left the prime minister’s official residence last week for an undisclosed location ahead of the Freedom Convoy’s arrival in Ottawa, claiming security concerns related to the demonstration.Nicholas described his political perceptions of the demonstration. “This isn’t about ‘anti-vax,'” he remarked. “This is about right to choose.”“I was born in another country,” he added, addressing allegations made by Trudeau and news media that “racism” and “white supremacy” are dominant themes animating their political detractors. He continued, “I was born in South America. I immigrated here with my family, so, I like to think that I’m far from ‘white supremacy.'”He went on, “There’s obviously a very multicultural crowd here, and Canada, of all places, had to be the one to do this because we show [and] we prove otherwise. We prove that this is a very multicultural group. It really is a very diverse group.”Nicholas concluded by emphasizing the contrast between the demonstration’s reality and false characterizations of it advanced by many Canadian news media outlets.He concluded, “Even behind us right now, there’s people singing and dancing. It’s the complete opposite of [how] media and politicians have been trying to portray it.”"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/08/canadian-left-accuses-justin-trudeau-of-leaving-leadership-void-after-vanishing-to-undisclosed-location/,"Far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing mounting frustration in his side of the political aisle for failing to act in the face of growing “Freedom Convoy” protests against coronavirus-related mandates – frustration he tried to stem by making a last-minute appearance in Parliament on Monday night.Trudeau announced that he had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus on January 31 and that he would be recovering in an undisclosed location. The announcement immediately preceded the arrival of a “Freedom Convoy” of trucks into Ottawa, where they have been parked since, honking in protest and demanding an end to vaccine mandates, mask mandates, and all restrictions on civil rights imposed by the Trudeau government in the name of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.The Ottawa protest has been, according to police, largely peaceful, attracting families and creating a party atmosphere in the city’s downtown. The prime minister emerged once during his quarantine to broadcast remarks from his undisclosed hideout dismissing the protesters as deranged, racist conspiracy theorists.“The concerns expressed by a few people gathered in Ottawa, right now, are not new, not surprising, are heard, but are a continuation of what we’ve unfortunately seen in disinformation and misinformation, online conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats,” Trudeau rambled early on in his isolation period.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family have reportedly fled their home in Ottawa for “a secret location,” as thousands of truckers traveling in a “freedom convoy” to protest vaccine mandates made their way to its capital city. https://t.co/ZMKF6EEw8z— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 30, 2022Trudeau made few comments and announced no policy to deal with the protests – which have spread beyond Ottawa to Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and several points along Canada’s southern border – prior to his last-minute appearance in Parliament on Monday. The Toronto Star observed that Trudeau offered the Canadian people “nearly four full days of silence” before resurfacing in Ottawa.Trudeau used the opportunity on Monday to repeatedly associate the entirety of the anti-mandate protests with “swastikas” and demand that the protest movement “has to stop.” He again refused to discuss meeting with protesters or addressing any of their concerns.The prime minister’s stance on the protests have naturally irked conservatives, but his appearance Monday did little to stem growing complaints on the left that he has no plan to end what leftists consider a “crisis” in the government’s relationship with the Canadian people. Among those concerned is communist leader of the New Democratic Party Jagmeet Singh, who called Monday night’s Parliament meeting and lamented that Trudeau has simply “not been visible” during the affair.A protester dressed as the fictional character “Waldo”, holds up a sign asking where is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 5, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. (Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)In his letter to Parliament House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota, Singh described the peaceful protests as putting Ottawa “under siege” and, while not mentioning Trudeau, wrote, “in times of crisis, it is important for federal leaders to show leadership, to urge deescalation, and to work together to find solutions.”Canada’s CTV broadcaster also noted that Trudeau is facing growing complaints from both sides that he is “being M.I.A. amid crisis.” Columnists at some of Canada’s largest papers, who clearly expressed no sympathy with the protest movement, published similar complaints.“Where is the Prime Minister? Has he got nothing? What is he doing about this?” columnist Campbell Clark asked in the pages of the Globe and Mail on Tuesday. Clark suggested that Trudeau’s Parliament appearance must have been the product of Trudeau himself becoming aware of the growing frustration with his “leadership void.”How DARE blackface enthusiast Justin Trudeau call ANYONE ""racist."" https://t.co/y8PcwfHl8i— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 2, 2022“After Ottawa’s mayor asked for a huge surge of police, Mr. Trudeau promised the feds would make available the resources the city needs to end the protests. He said Transport Minister Omar Alghabra would work with provincial authorities to ensure protesters face consequences,” Clark wrote. “But this was a belated effort 11 days into an episode that has seen authorities of all levels and politicians of all stripes fall short of actual leadership.”“Mr. Trudeau’s surprise evening appearance was a belated attempt to throw something into the void of leadership – one that Ottawa residents have now seen at every level, and from every stripe,” he concluded.At the Toronto Star, columnist Heather Scoffield applauded Trudeau for once being at “the forefront of efforts to keep aggressive populism at bay,” and wondered where the Trudeau of the past had gone.“The demonstrators are not the face of law-abiding, mostly vaccinated Canadians, but of a fed-up public that is fraying in the face of repeated pandemic constraints and fears for the future,” Scoffield alleged. “Trudeau has made that case with clarity. … But there’s no case for his near-silence to the broader Canadian public about the crisis that has overrun Parliament Hill.”Scoffield acknowledged Trudeau’s coronavirus diagnosis.“Of course, Trudeau has been confined to isolation after he and two of his children tested positive for [Chinese coronavirus]. But officials say he is feeling fine,” she wrote. “And Trudeau, more than anyone, knows how to reach out to the public from the confines of his home office. Indeed, he has made several virtual appearances over the past 10 days.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. "
https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2022/02/08/fncs-carlson-how-long-before-canadian-trucker-protests-come-here/,"Monday, FNC host Tucker Carlson reacted to the trucker protest north of the border, primarily in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.Carlson speculated there was a fear in the U.S. media that those protests could come South. He referred to MSNBC morning show hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski’s reaction as proof.Transcript as follows:CARLSON: “Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose, but your chains.” That’s from Karl Marx, of course. He wrote that famous phrase in 1848. The weird thing is, it’s pretty likely that Marx himself never met an actual worker.Wait a second. He didn’t spend a decade in a cotton mill witnessing the oppression firsthand? No. Karl Marx never spent a moment in a factory. He was a rich kid who became a journalist. Of course, he was.But for more than 150 years, Karl Marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it. Over time, workers became working men or working class, and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. Ordinary people, wage earners are getting shafted.So they’ve got to unite. They’ve got to come together for protection and for dignity. This was the idea of course behind the organized labor movement.And every Democratic President from Andrew Jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again, the noble people of Scranton, you hear it even today.So Democrats have repeated that line often enough, you would think they really mean it. Do they really mean it? Well, let’s take the test just so you know.Watch what happens when actual workers, working people from working families who constitute the working class, actually come together as a group to protest how things are going. What happens then?Does the intellectual class greet these workers as heroes through a parade? Listen intently to their stories? Does NPR do a sympathetic feature on them? Or do self-described progressives recoil in revulsion and horror at the grubbiness of the people who as we used to say, work for a living? Do liberals immediately denounce them as Nazis and called for their suppression by force? That’s the question. What’s the answer?Well, ask Trump voters what happens, they’ll know.Or consider what’s happening right now in Canada. Thousands of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of Justin Trudeau’s government. Justin Trudeau does not like truck drivers. He thinks they are revolting.Justin Trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls and other people who give him money. Trudeau is not in Ottawa right now. In fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they’ve been in hiding ever since.So when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, Justin Trudeau wasn’t there to see it. He ran away in terror, kind of sad. So instead, in his place, his friend Mark Carney has been speaking for him. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive, who many believe will replace Justin Trudeau if Trudeau ever decides to give up power.In a recent op-ed, Mark Carney vented his rage of the impudent truckers in Ottawa and anyone who sent the money on the internet, quote: “… anyone sending money to the convoys should be in no doubt,” Carney wrote, “… you are funding sedition. Foreign funders have an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.”Got that? It’s not a protest. It’s sedition. It’s an insurrection.Clearly, Mark Carney has been watching a lot of CNN up there in Canada and that is why he has included the truckers should be crushed by force, quote: “Those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of law.” People who sent the money should be prosecuted. If they’re not prosecuted Mark Carney fears quote, “… the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.”Are you laughing yet? So the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. Hilarious.It would be interesting by the way to poll small business owners in Ottawa to see what they think. How do they feel about the truckers? Somebody would know exactly what those results would be, but no one’s doing that poll, of course. Instead, they found an easier way, Justin Trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down.How do you do that? How do you stop a truck protest? Simple. You seize their fuel. That’s exactly what police in Canada are doing. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, in fact, yes, they are taking fuel away from people as they attempt to fuel their vehicles.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Okay, so we are through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. So let’s pause a moment to savor the irony here. The very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working class Canadians who are trying to stay alive in arctic temperatures. As they used to say in the 1960s, scratch a liberal and you will find a fascist. That was a Black Panther slogan actually. They weren’t entirely stupid. In fact in this case, they were absolutely right.According to Justin Trudeau, possessing gasoline in the City of Ottawa is now a crime. Now, to be clear, Ottawa didn’t declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire, shot someone or leveled a church, BLM did all of those things, but Justin Trudeau strongly supports BLM. He reaffirmed his support the other day.Here is the problem, and we’re going to let the mayor of Ottawa or Ottawa as it is correctly pronounced Jibowu (ph) explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to Canada.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JIM WATSON, OTTAWA, CANADA: It’s disturbing when you see the protests turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival where they’ve got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows a great deal of insensitivity.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: They’ve got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of Ottawa. Let’s hurt them.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a dark scene in Truckistan tonight. The kids are on the bouncy castles. Of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime.Watch this protester, a white supremacist explain his motives for protest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where the hell were you? You weren’t there. But, now you want to come out in the freezing cold to oppose my fundamental human rights and freedoms.I’m not going to have it. I’m a Black man standing beside my brother right here. This is my brother right here and none of you have the right to tell me who to associate with and who not to associate with me because you did not come out and voice your concerns for the fact that Justin Trudeau banned me from leaving this country because of my medical decision, because I made a decision that he did not like.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Shut up, racist. Go back to Jamaica with your white supremacy nonsense.By the way, no one in Canada’s government or the media in Canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. Instead, they’ve gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. They don’t have an argument to make, all they have is police power and they’re using them.Officials in Ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the California company, GoFundMe because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. Here is Ottawa’s Police Chief bragging about stealing that money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHIEF PETER SLOLY, OTTAWA POLICE: We have, through the efforts of Deputy Bell, Christian Henow (ph), the mayor and his staff, we’ve been able to shut down the GoFundMe program. That’s a temporary reprieve because the funds are already moving in different directions.We are now going after supply and fuel coming into the area through investigations and intelligence operations and interdictions, all of which were underway yesterday, fully underway today.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Intelligence operations? This is a peaceful, political protest. No one has shown any evidence to the contrary. It’s not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. It’s not al-Qaeda. These are Canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they’re being treated like a terror group.GoFundMe announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably BLM, which it has supported since the very beginning. In other words, GoFundMe plan to steal that money.They were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of American Attorneys General who threatened to sue the companies. So the company backed off and they’re going to refund the money, supposedly. But still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it.So, in the absence of GoFundMe doing what it’s supposed to do, others are filling the gap. An alternative crowdfunding website called GiveSendGo has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. How long until they try to shut that down, too?Some Canadians are clearly worried about that. They’re turning to cryptocurrency. Tally Coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It’s not controlled by banks. That’s the point. They’re hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don’t control crypto.Bitcoin goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.It’s pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they’ll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.Either way, it’s becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold, the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. That doesn’t apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. You can’t organize if you can’t talk to other people.So Facebook, for example, just shut down the “Convoy to D.C. Group,” which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. No one is allowed to promote the organization anymore. Facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in Canada. Of course, they are. That seems like a story, but our media have ignored it.Instead, everyone in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with Silicon Valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. It makes sense.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Those with the so-called freedom convoy say they’re staying put until vaccine mandates are dropped, the masks come off, and life returns to the way it was.JAMES MACDONALD, PROTESTER: This whole event has gone beyond just vaccines and it is now about the entire ordeal.SUZANNE AND PAUL, PROTESTERS: We’re asking for our freedom. That’s all we want.NEWTON: So, they’ve been free, free to park big rigs right next to the Prime Minister’s Office, free to set up camp in front of the country’s National Parliament. Ottawa Police say they have learned much in the past week, especially after reports of assaults, intimidation and allegations of hate speech and symbols.SLOLY: This remains, as it was from the beginning, an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration.NEWTON: And it is spreading like a contagion itself right across the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It’s spreading like a contagion. Now, you knew that CNN was the Praetorian Guard for our ruling class. Did you know they serve the same role in Canada and what other countries? How much money does CNN take from the government of Canada? That’d be worth finding out.They described what’s happening in Ottawa as a, quote: “violent and dangerous demonstration.” Really? Where is the violence coming from? The only people getting injured or have been injured so far are the protesters, the truckers.In Winnipeg on Friday, an anarchist called David Zegarac drove his jeep into four people who were protesting vaccine mandates. You’re seeing that on the screen right now.Zegarac didn’t stop after hitting the people, he fled. Police shortly, they arrested him. Of course, police are treating the incident like a hit and run. Nothing political. It’s not domestic terrorism or anything. David Zegarac, his views, they agree with. He’s a progressive, a true believer. How much is he a true believer?Well, if you look closely, you’ll notice that Zegarac has his mask on driving alone in his car during the assault, prima facie evidence of mental illness, something you see in this country all the time, and it makes you wonder: If you’re driving alone with a mask on, do you pose a danger to pedestrians? Entirely possible. Someone should fund a study on that. That seems like a big story, especially since it’s happening just an hour from our own border, all of this.The question is: How long before protests like this come here? Clearly, our media are worried about that. Watch the morning news anchors on MSNBC. They’re deeply, deeply concerned about these uppity working-class people. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Where were these protests when people were required to give their children five vaccines?MIKE BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: They were in the doctor’s office getting vaccines.SCARBOROUGH: They were in the doctor’s office getting vaccines and they were making fun of left-wingers on the West Coast for being loopy anti- vaxxers. Now, they have met the enemy and the enemy, their enemy, is themselves because they’ve become what they hated. It’s a cult.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So here you have Joe and Mika sneering from their studio in Florida at the freezing wage earners stuck outside in Ottawa in February because they want their human rights. Screw them.Will Joe Scarborough say that to their faces? Probably not.Scarborough is famously tough on young female employees. Some say he’s an absolute killer in the office, but it’s hard to imagine Scarborough talking like this if there was an actual Canadian trucker in the room.Truckers in this country are watching all of this, and you wonder: What do they think about it? What would happen if American truck drivers decided they’d had enough of people like Joe Scarborough and went on strike? What would happen then?Well, this country would stop immediately, no more deliveries of anything. Over time that would mean starvation for people in the cities, but even in the short term, there would be profound suffering in this country.For example, and this is something that too few people outside of television even consider, the world’s entire supply of Botox is manufactured on the West Coast of Ireland. That’s a long way from here. In fact, it’s a 4,000 mile long supply chain from the Allergan plant in Westport, Ireland to Jupiter, Florida.Now, people at MSNBC might not be aware of this, but our country has no domestic Botox production, along with Vitamin C, and antibiotics. It’s one of the lifesaving pharmaceutical products we have recklessly offshored.So if the trucks stop delivering, the Botox stops coming and suddenly your morning television anchors are going to look like they’re 58 years old, which actually they are.Could that happen? Is it impossible? No, it’s not impossible. The people in charge aren’t really thinking this through. Most of the time, trends start in the United States and they move north to Canada, but this time, the opposite could happen.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

The second thing to know is that in Canada, more than 99% of journalists receive a payment from Justin Trudeau. Here’s the list of the journalists who took Trudeau’s $61 million pre-election pay-off: https://t.co/loGh7YgWqVIt’s more than 99% of working journalists.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20223. There is an illusion of media competition in Canada, but it’s an oligopoly. Postmedia — the largest recipient of Trudeau’s media bail-out — owns every English-language daily newspaper in Canada, except two. And even they just run the same wire copy as their competitors.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20224. And Trudeau’s CBC state broadcaster is larger than all other news media combined. Every non-CBC journalist tailors their work so that, if they’re laid off, they can get hired at the CBC, since it’s “too big to fail”. It’s the last resort.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20225. There used to be some conservative media in Canada, e.g. the National Post. But for years they hired woke leftist underminers. Personnel is policy. A majority of their newsroom signed a letter to fire their star columnist. They’re no better than CBC: https://t.co/fSvGLXn854— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20226. TV is the worst, of course. They are highly regulated by the CRTC, which has the power to kill any TV or radio station. They cancel the licence of any company that airs conservative views that offend the regime. Example: https://t.co/sXrNfd4ob1— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20227. When I worked at Sun News I learned that the TV part of TV companies was economically unimportant compared to the cell phone and cable side of the business. That’s how the CRTC pressures TV companies. News shows are a rounding error compared to regulatory givings and takings.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20228. These are all structural issues. But an obvious point is the lack of diversity in the news media. I don’t mean race or sex — I mean intellectual and class diversity. The Media Party (as I call it) is politically and culturally homogenous. Urban, woke think-alikes.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 20229. They don’t know any truckers or farmers or anyone who works outside or wears a hard hat or a uniform. My favorite tweet from the Globe and Mail was this masterpiece. The reporter covering the working classes thought this was a wrecking ball and got scared. pic.twitter.com/mnKQrBTw2n— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202210. How can this rotting industry — monopolistic; corrupted by government money; regulated by government censors; a political monoculture; infected by woke cancel culture — possibly cover a populist workers rebellion? They are intellectually and structurally incapable of it.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202211. Psychologically, these middle class narcissists (every journalist must be a narcissist to believe the world needs to hear what they have to say) cannot believe that the working classes reject them. They always posed as saviours of the working man. It made them feel better.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202212. So the Toronto Star, with its Marxist Atkinson Principles, calls for martial law against working men. They’re for the mass firing of unvaccinated union members, a violation of collective agreements. They’re in bed with Big Pharma. They don’t use the phrase pro-choice anymore.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202213. My point is, for the media to report what’s really happening out there — 100,000+ truckers across the country; 1M people or more who cheered them along the way — would destroy not only the media’s worldview but their self-image. They just cannot believe their eyes.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202214. The pro-Trudeau pollster Abacus shows that 32% of Canadians see themselves in the trucker convoy. If the truckers were a political party, they would immediately be in first place. This is enormous cognitive dissonance to the Media Party who keep calling it a radical fringe. pic.twitter.com/jQgVqI7KrX— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202215. A reason why the Media Party narrative is failing is that a million people have had first-hand contact with the truckers. The revolution IS being televised, just not on CBC. It’s alive on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. These aren’t “racists”: pic.twitter.com/ymb87CZ18G— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202216. So many institutions have failed during the pandemic — Parliament, the opposition Conservatives, the courts, colleges of physicians and surgeons, police, etc. But the media has failed the most. But because they are immune to most consequences, they haven’t noticed it yet.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202217. They don’t understand why people don’t trust them. Here’s CTV, mad that the convoy they’ve been defaming for two weeks won’t invite them in to a press conference as an honoured guest: https://t.co/2vRNmoZpIb— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202218. The icing on the cake is that CTV is part of the government press gallery that excludes conservative media (like Rebel News) from the Parliament. They voted to protect Trudeau from our questions (but they’re accepting applications from Xinhua): https://t.co/WsgZxkWyZc— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202219. CTV is huge. They’re owned by Bell, the cell phone and cable company, that also owns two NHL teams. Which helps explain why they liked the lockdowns so much — but lobbied for special exemptions for them, but not for your kids’ hockey teams.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202220. CTV seems large to you, but it’s unimportant as a business to Bell, it’s a rounding error. It’s value to Bell is the same reason Jeff Bezos bought Washington Post or Carlos Slim bought NY Times: it’s a way to influence government. It’s a lobby group. Your mind is the product.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202221. Even if there were an independent journalist at CTV, they wouldn’t be able to contradict the corporate objectives of Bell. The Globe is owned by the Woodbridge Company. Postmedia is owned by New Jersey’s Chatham Asset Management. They’re all political toys of billionaires.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202222. I have to go to work now (I’m not some government journalist like those at Trudeau’s CBC state broadcaster, or the 99% of Canadian reporters whose paycheque is directly subsidized by Trudeau). But let me leave you with this delicious moment…— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202223. We had reporters at NINE different trucker convoys on the weekend. We’re embedded at the border in Coutts. We’ve got half a dozen people in Ottawa (on the street, not safely tucked away in offices). So people choose our news over the Media Party’s punditry.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202224. The whole world is riveted by what’s happening in Canada. But who can they talk to about what’s really happening? They could call the CBC, and I’m sure CNN does. But that’s just Trudeau’s point of view, it’s not really telling you what’s happening. So they call us.— Ezra Levant (@ezralevant) February 8, 202225. Yesterday alone our team must have done ten foreign interviews. I was on Tucker Carlson; our young reporter @lincolnmjay was on Hannity (I'll have to find that clip). Those two shows are, what, 8 million views? pic.twitter.com/9S0lnpjLJS— Ezra Levant  (@ezralevant) February 8, 202226. So what's a government journalist to do?

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/08/ottawa-police-brutalize-78-year-old-man-for-honking/,"Ottawa police detained and brutalized a 78-year-old man identified as Gerry Charlebois on Monday for violating the ban imposed that day on honking car horns. Police appear in multiple videos twisting the elderly man’s arm around his back and shoving him into the side of a car.The arrest took place amid attempts to crack down on a trucker-led protest in Canada’s capital dubbed the “Freedom Convoy” demanding an end to civil rights abuses by the Canadian government in the name of stopping the spread of Chinese coronavirus, including vaccine and mask mandates and business shutdowns. Over a week into the protest, the assembly has remained largely peaceful and manifested largely through incessant truck honking. A local court granted an injunction that bans any car honking in the city for ten days on Monday.The images of police battering Carlebois are particularly striking given his small size – Carlebois’s family told the Toronto Sun on Monday that he is 4’10” – and the fact that the mandates the Freedom Convoy is protesting are ostensibly meant to protect people more vulnerable to severe coronavirus infections, like the elderly.I spoke with him. He’s in pain. He’s 4 foot 10. A retired janitor with 11 grandkids, 4 great grandkids. If this disgraceful treatment of a 78 year old for honking his horn and a thumbs up to a trucker is acceptable to @JustinTrudeau @fordnation @JimWatsonOttawa no one is safe. https://t.co/DBgPLpCquX— Joe Warmington (@joe_warmington) February 8, 2022Speaking to the Sun‘s Joe Warmington, Charlebois confirmed the incident and explained that he was not a protester or engaged in any disruptive activity. He is vaccinated. He has no criminal record and was “confused” as to why police would stop him for honking a horn; the court had just banned such an action within hours of the detention. Charlebois told Warmington that he wanted to go to the downtown neighborhood to “look at the trucks” but did not walk into the protest site specifically because he thought it may be dangerous. “I decided it was too much so I just looked from the van and then started to head home.”In the time in which he was preparing to head home, a truck drove past, to which he offered “a thumbs up and a honk.” Police then battered him in response to the honk.Warmington reported that Charlebois has suffered several cuts, bruises, and aches as a result of the attack. His sons, who also spoke to the Sun, said that Charlebois may need to visit the hospital to ensure that he does not have any long-term injuries, as he cannot move his arm properly and now has a “very messed-up shoulder.”Police had not yet commented on the incident at press time.I have put request to ⁦@OttawaPolice⁩ ⁦@JimWatsonOttawa⁩ ⁦@OPSChiefSloly⁩ To verify a video that shows an elderly man being taken to ground and handcuffed and taken away. Since I have not heard back I’m asking now publicly for verification. And for any witnesses pic.twitter.com/3iUBG9S4Mo— Joe Warmington (@joe_warmington) February 7, 2022Ottawa police announced on Sunday, prior to the injunction passing, that authorities had arrested seven people within a 24-hour window and opened “over 60 criminal investigations” – small numbers given the thousands attending the protests – and conceded that most of those investigations were for “mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage.” Six of the seven arrests on Sunday were on charges of “mischief.”The relatively minor police action – and the victims of said action, like Charlebois – contrast with the image of the protesters that leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has attempted to cultivate. Discussing the protesters during a last-minute visit to Parliament on Monday, Trudeau repeatedly accused the protesters of displaying “swastikas.” He has in the past equated distrust of coronavirus vaccine products with racism and misogyny. More recently, he referred to mandate opponents as wearers of “tinfoil hats.”Trudeau has taken a less hard line against the protesters than Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly, however, who has threatened to dislodge the honking truckers by any means necessary.“All options are on the table, from negotiation through to enforcement,” Sloly said of removing the protesters last week. Trudeau has personally intervened to remove both options mentioned, refusing to meet with or address protesters’ concerns in any way, but also asserting that military intervention was “not in the cards” at the moment. The different approaches have created an appearance of significant tension between Trudeau and Ottawa police.“This is a national issue, not an Ottawa issue,” Sloly told city councillors on Wednesday. “I am increasingly concerned there is no policing solution to this.”Trudeau also appeared to have lost support from the left, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the fact that the protests not only appear not to be waning, but have expanded into other cities such as Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.“Where is the Prime Minister? Has he got nothing? What is he doing about this?” a column in the Globe and Mail national newspaper asked on Tuesday.Radical leftist New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh took the lead this week in criticizing Trudeau from the left, asserting that the prime minister has “not been visible” and calling an emergency Parliament meeting to address the protests in the absence of any action by Trudeau. Trudeau attended the emergency meeting, where lawmakers urged him to provide ideas and solutions to end the protests and generally quell public unrest.Simon Kent contributed to this reporting.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."
https://www.breitbart.com/news/canadas-covid-19-protests-threaten-border-trade-with-us/,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canadian lawmakers expressed increasing worry Tuesday about the economic effects of disruptive demonstrations after the busiest border crossing between the U.S. and Canada became partially blocked by truckers protesting vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions.Ontario Premier Doug Ford called the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, a “vital trade artery.” It carries 25 percent of trade between the two countries.“Such blockades will have serious implications on our economy and our supply chain,” Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said in Ottawa, the capital. “I’ve already heard from automakers and food grocers. This is really a serious cause for concern.”Speaking in an emergency debate late Monday in Parliament, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the protesters are “trying to blockade our economy, our democracy,” and it has to stop.The daily demonstrations staged by the so-called Freedom Truck Convoy began in Ottawa, where demonstrators have used hundreds of parked trucks to paralyze parts of the capital for more than 10 days. The protests have infuriated people who live around downtown, including neighborhoods near Parliament Hill, the seat of the federal government.Dave Weatherall, a federal civil servant, lives near the truckers’ prime staging area in a city-owned parking lot outside of the downtown core. “They’re using the lot to terrorize people in Centretown,” he said, asking why the city has allowed the convoy to remain parked on its property for free and without intervention.“It’s the first time since having kids that I’ve seriously wondered about the world we brought them into. I always figured they could handle most things the world will throw at them, but this feels different,” he said.Demonstrations have spread to locations on or near the Canadian border, including the Ambassador Bridge, where a protest caused long backups and at one point stopped traffic in both directions. The bridge remains blocked on the road to Canada.At a news conference after Trudeau spoke, trucker spokesman Tom Marrazo reiterated that the protesters want to overthrow the government. Marrazo said he is willing to meet with the opposition parties and the nation’s governor general, the representative of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.All three opposition parties technically could join together and defeat the government because Trudeau does not have the majority of seats in Parliament, but that is highly unlikely because the vast majority of lawmakers have condemned the protests.Protesters have also closed another important U.S. Canada border crossing in Coutts, Alberta.“The border at Coutts continues to open and close at the discretion of a group of protesters who believe they are above the law. It has to stop,” tweeted Rachel Notley, Alberta’s former premier and current opposition New Democrat leader.Protesters have said they will not leave until all vaccine mandates and COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. They also called for the removal of Trudeau’s government, though it is responsible for few of the restrictive measures, most of which were put in place by provincial governments.François Laporte, the president of Teamsters Canada, which represents over 55,000 drivers, including 15,000 long-haul truck drivers, said the protests do not represent the industry in which 90% of drivers are vaccinated.The Freedom Convoy “and the despicable display of hate lead by the political Right and shamefully encouraged by elected conservative politicians does not reflect the values of Teamsters Canada, nor the vast majority of our members, and in fact has served to de-legitimize the real concerns of most truck drivers today,” Laporte said in a statement.Joel Lightbound, a lawmaker for Trudeau’s Liberal Party, rebuked his leader Tuesday for dividing Canadians and said his government needs to create a road map for when coronavirus measures should be lifted.“It is time we stopped dividing people, to stop pitting one part of the population against each other,” Lightbound said. “I can’t help but notice that both the tone and actions of my government changed drastically on the eve and during the last election campaign. From a positive and unifying approach a decision was made to wedge, to divide and to stigmatize.”Trudeau continues to take a hard line against the protesters. The prime minister said during Monday’s Parliament debate that everyone is tired of COVID-19, and that the restrictions will not last forever. He noted that Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.Meanwhile, the Canadian province of Saskatchewan became the first in the country to announce a plan to lift all COVID-19 restrictions. Saskatchewan officials said they will no longer require COVID-19 vaccine passports starting Monday. The province with a population of almost 1.2 million people is also ending its indoor mask mandate at the end of the month.Conservative Premier Scott Moe said the benefits of providing proof of vaccination to enter businesses such as restaurants no longer outweigh the cost. He said the passport has created deep divisions in the province.“I suspect other provinces will do something similar in the next while. I would ask the federal government as well on behalf of all Canadians to continue to revisit the orders that they have in place,” Moe said. “We are incumbent to remove them when they have run their course.”Bruce Heyman, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada, noted that the U.S. and Canada have one of the most significant trading relationships of any two countries in the world, with about $2 billion in daily trade of goods and services. Any blockade of the Ambassador Bridge cannot continue for long as it also critical to the U.S. supply lines, he said.The bridge “is also a key access crossing for cross-border jobs such as Canadian nurses in Detroit hospitals and, of course, cross-border access to medical care,” Heyman said.____Gillies reported from Toronto. "
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/08/conservative-opposition-leader-candice-bergen-to-trudeau-do-you-regret-disrespecting-canadians/,"Conservative Party leader Candice Bergen confronted leftist Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday about his repeated use of insults and epithets against individuals who choose not to receive a coronavirus vaccination product, asking if he regretted the role he played in dividing the country.Trudeau made a last-minute appearance in Parliament for Monday’s emergency session, called by communist New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, after retreating to an undisclosed location at the start of the protests now known as the “Freedom Convoy,” which have taken over much of the country. Trudeau announced at the beginning of his retreat that he had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus, necessitating isolation. The largest Freedom Convoy protest is in Ottawa, the nation’s capital, where truckers have flooded the streets and protested government civil rights abuses in the name of public health largely through honking.Trucks parked in downtown Ottawa continue to protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions, on February 4, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)An Ottawa court issued a ban on car horn honking for ten days on Monday in response to the protest.Supporters gather at Parliament Hill for the Freedom Truck Convoy in Ottawa, Canada, on January 29, 2022. (LARS HAGBERG/AFP via Getty Images)Elsewhere in the country, “Freedom Convoy” protests have occurred in multiple places along the U.S.-Canada border and major cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.Protesters assert that they oppose business lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine mandates, bans on religious gatherings, school restrictions, and any other government civil rights abuses meant to stop the spread of Chinese coronavirus. The protests have been largely peaceful, but leftist politicians, including Trudeau, have repeatedly accused opponents of the restrictions and supporters of the protests generally of unrelated inappropriate views, such as racism.During his remarks on Monday, Trudeau equated the thousands of “Freedom Convoy” protesters with Nazis, implying falsely that swastikas are common sights at the protests.“I look at our country Mr. Speaker, and I’ve never seen it as divided as it is now under this prime minister,” Bergen, who became interim Conservative leader after the ouster of Ed O’Toole in the aftermath of the protests this month, told Trudeau. “Whether its regional lines, whether its ethnic lines, whether it’s people’s health care choices – this country is more divided than ever.”Bergen then asked Trudeau if he took responsibility for his part in creating such a scenario.“Does he regret calling people names who didn’t take the vaccine?” Bergen asked of Trudeau. “Does he regret calling people misogynist and racist and just, escalating and poking sticks at them and being so divisive to individual Canadians that he might not disagree with, that he might have thought were wrong?”“Does he regret that,” she concluded, “and will he agree to meet with the leaders here, the other opposition leaders and myself, so that we can talk about a solution in a way that he’s described?”Bergen asserted that the current wave of protests and general political situation was “uncharted territory” for the country.Trudeau did not answer either question, instead insisting that the protests did not represent a significant enough population of Canadians that it merited a response from him.“A few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,” Trudeau said, comparing the alleged swastika-wavers to Canadians “being able to pull a car out of a snowbank for a perfect stranger.”Trudeau has rejected all calls for him to address the protesters or their concerns. In remarks from his undisclosed location, Trudeau dismissed all people disgruntled with his government’s handling of the pandemic as conspiracy theorists.“The concerns expressed by a few people gathered in Ottawa, right now, are not new, not surprising, are heard, but are a continuation of what we’ve unfortunately seen in disinformation and misinformation, online conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats,” Trudeau claimed.Trudeau has in the past used the terms “racist” and “misogynist” to refer to people who do not receive Chinese coronavirus vaccine product doses.Bergen has, since becoming Conservative leader, attacked Trudeau multiple times for accusing mandate protesters of being racists, noting that Trudeau himself has a long history of wearing blackface – a reality that surfaced in the 2019 election cycle but caused no significant political damage to Trudeau. The prime minister told reporters at the time that he could not guarantee that the multiple photos that had surfaced of him wearing blackface were the only ones, because he had worn blackface on various occasions.Trudeau’s absence during much of the Freedom Convoy protests has outraged the protesters and prompted significant criticism from the protests’ opponents.“I didn’t serve this country to be bullied by a prime minister that ran away like a chicken,” Darryl, a retired corporal from the Canadian Army who served in Afghanistan, told Breitbart News from downtown Ottawa on Saturday. “Who runs away from their people? It’s insane. If I was in the army right now, I’d be contemplating leaving just because our leadership, our military, our country, will have no credibility because of him [Trudeau].”Media commenters who have written in columns of their opposition to the convoy also blamed Trudeau in various articles this week for the protests’ prolonged existence, as he has done nothing to address them.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

And similar events were reported in Fairbanks and late last month in Juneau.Fox News also reported on the “Alaska Freedom Convoy” in support of the Canadian “Freedom Convoy,” which is entering its second week.Anchorage Assembly member Jamie Allard organized the U.S. protest, according to Fox News. “We want to support our truckers,” Allard told KTUU. “Without them, we’re not getting our supply. We need to get our supplies here. People need to be recognized for everything we’re doing here in our city.”“We are taking part in the Freedom Convoy standing in solidarity with truckers in Canada and really across North America. We stand for their freedom to choose,” Kelly Tshibaka said in a video posted Sunday from the cab of a truck. Tshibaka, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, is challenging Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski in the 2022 midterms for the incumbent’s Senate seat.“We also stand with them as they fight for their jobs, their families, and their abilities to take care of their communities. This is really about freedom,” she continued. “Freedom from people who want to be tyrants and dictate what we put into our bodies. We are against mandates from our political leaders. Political leaders shouldn’t push their way into the patient-provider relationship.”“That’s how much we support freedom in Alaska,” Tshibaka said.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter"

Global News reported that the demonstrations are headed into the second week of protest.“We’ve contacted them all and they’re all refusing … to provide heavy tow truck work,” Kanellakos said in a press conference. However, he explained that the tow truck operators are still doing “light” work, not heavy trucks and larger vehicles.“Many of them or most of them don’t want to do the work, especially the heavy tow truck work, because they rely on the heavy truck industry for their livelihood and they don’t want to damage that part of their business,” Kanellakos explained.The city’s mayor, Jim Watson, has reportedly been in touch and asked for resources from city officials in Toronto, Brampton, and other Ontario cities, according to Kanellakos. He also explained that the problems removing the “Freedom Convoy” are happening all over and not “an Ottawa-only problem.”Local police Deputy Chief Steve Bell, not willing to share the specifics, said that the police are trying to find “creative solutions” to remove demonstrators since they do not have any cooperation from tow truck companies.“We are coming towards a position where we’re not going to let the tow truck operators, and the ability to tow those vehicles out of there, be an obstacle to ending what’s occurring,” Bell said.The top city officials noted that the city is reviewing its contract with the tow truck operators in order to see “what actions we can take to deal with this unprecedented situation.”Jacob Bliss is a reporter for Breitbart News.

We recognize truck drivers are essential workers that work hard to deliver necessities to all of us and that the Canadian government has done a tremendous job with vaccine rates,” Moroun said.“The Ambassador Bridge has a solemn obligation to facilitate safe and efficient international trade and travel. We encourage the appropriate officials to take prompt action to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible in a manner that reflects mutual respect,” he concluded.Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce CEO Rakesh Naidu was less sympathetic to the protesters.“Many businesses have been through so much in the last two years. This couldn’t come at a worse time. To constrict the border like this will impact everyone not just in Windsor, but Ontario and Canada. You have thousands of businesses that rely on the border and trade coming through. You have inventory based on just-in-time delivery,” Naidu told the Windsor Star on Tuesday.“Any disruption of supply can lead to shifts being canceled and if it continues, closing operations,” Naidu cautioned. “All of that doesn’t just impact the businesses in all the different sectors, but consumers like you and me. This is not just manufacturing, but goods we all consume as well, like fresh produce, or chemicals and fuel that we need.”Writing at the Toronto Sun on Tuesday, columnist Brian Lilley saw the Ambassador Bridge protest as a possible turning point in the Freedom Convoy saga, because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no good answer to it.“Will Trudeau dismiss these people as racists like he does everyone else who disagrees with him? That’s what Trudeau has done in the past with several people or groups opposed to him and it seems to be the only response he has to the protests in Ottawa,” Lilley wrote.“This is all about politics and Trudeau’s desire to pump up his base of supporters against the protesters, attach the protest movement to Conservatives, and reap the rewards with increased voter support if or when violent confrontation with the police takes place,” he charged, contrasting Trudeau’s confrontational and insulting attitude toward Canadian truckers with his support for Indian farm protesters last year.“That single bridge connecting Windsor to Detroit carries 27% of the total two-way trade between Canada and the United States. Yelling racist won’t fix this problem. Perhaps it’s time for Trudeau to offer the same dialogue to Canadian protesters as he offered to Indian protesters,” Lilley concluded."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/08/white-house-defends-rights-of-canadian-trucker-protesters-as-justin-trudeau-smears-freedom-convoy/,"The White House on Tuesday backed the right of Canadian truckers to protest Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the overbearing coronavirus restrictions and vaccine mandates.“We of course support as you know the right to freedom of speech and protest,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during the daily briefing on Tuesday.“Everyone can peacefully protest, we fully support that,” she added.The White House response differs from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who smeared Freedom Convoy protestors as a “fringe minority” with “unacceptable views” and described them as racist.The ongoing protests of the Canadian vaccine mandates and coronavirus restrictions shut down traffic on the Ambassador Bridge between Canada and Detroit on Monday, a major trade route with the United States.Psaki, however, downplayed the idea that the congestion was directly related to vaccine requirements, claiming there is “zero indication” that vaccine requirements in various industries cause disruptions.“While we do see some of these congestions due to protests, it’s clear these disruptions have broadened in scope beyond the vaccine requirement implementation,” she said.Psaki defended the idea of vaccine mandates but acknowledged the protests were having an impact.“We know that requirements work,” she said. “We have not seen a disruption as it relates to requirements in the industry, where we have seen disruption has been related to these convoys and protests.”When asked about reports of an organization of truckers in the United States protesting vaccine mandates conducting their own protest in Washington, D.C., Psaki deferred to security and law enforcement officials in the administration."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/08/fncs-carlson-how-long-before-canadian-trucker-protests-come-here/,"Monday, FNC host Tucker Carlson reacted to the trucker protest north of the border, primarily in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.Carlson speculated there was a fear in the U.S. media that those protests could come South. He referred to MSNBC morning show hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski’s reaction as proof.Transcript as follows:CARLSON: “Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose, but your chains.” That’s from Karl Marx, of course. He wrote that famous phrase in 1848. The weird thing is, it’s pretty likely that Marx himself never met an actual worker.Wait a second. He didn’t spend a decade in a cotton mill witnessing the oppression firsthand? No. Karl Marx never spent a moment in a factory. He was a rich kid who became a journalist. Of course, he was.But for more than 150 years, Karl Marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it. Over time, workers became working men or working class, and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. Ordinary people, wage earners are getting shafted.So they’ve got to unite. They’ve got to come together for protection and for dignity. This was the idea of course behind the organized labor movement.And every Democratic President from Andrew Jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again, the noble people of Scranton, you hear it even today.So Democrats have repeated that line often enough, you would think they really mean it. Do they really mean it? Well, let’s take the test just so you know.Watch what happens when actual workers, working people from working families who constitute the working class, actually come together as a group to protest how things are going. What happens then?Does the intellectual class greet these workers as heroes through a parade? Listen intently to their stories? Does NPR do a sympathetic feature on them? Or do self-described progressives recoil in revulsion and horror at the grubbiness of the people who as we used to say, work for a living? Do liberals immediately denounce them as Nazis and called for their suppression by force? That’s the question. What’s the answer?Well, ask Trump voters what happens, they’ll know.Or consider what’s happening right now in Canada. Thousands of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of Justin Trudeau’s government. Justin Trudeau does not like truck drivers. He thinks they are revolting.Justin Trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls and other people who give him money. Trudeau is not in Ottawa right now. In fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they’ve been in hiding ever since.So when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, Justin Trudeau wasn’t there to see it. He ran away in terror, kind of sad. So instead, in his place, his friend Mark Carney has been speaking for him. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive, who many believe will replace Justin Trudeau if Trudeau ever decides to give up power.In a recent op-ed, Mark Carney vented his rage of the impudent truckers in Ottawa and anyone who sent the money on the internet, quote: “… anyone sending money to the convoys should be in no doubt,” Carney wrote, “… you are funding sedition. Foreign funders have an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.”Got that? It’s not a protest. It’s sedition. It’s an insurrection.Clearly, Mark Carney has been watching a lot of CNN up there in Canada and that is why he has included the truckers should be crushed by force, quote: “Those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of law.” People who sent the money should be prosecuted. If they’re not prosecuted Mark Carney fears quote, “… the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.”Are you laughing yet? So the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. Hilarious.It would be interesting by the way to poll small business owners in Ottawa to see what they think. How do they feel about the truckers? Somebody would know exactly what those results would be, but no one’s doing that poll, of course. Instead, they found an easier way, Justin Trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down.How do you do that? How do you stop a truck protest? Simple. You seize their fuel. That’s exactly what police in Canada are doing. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, in fact, yes, they are taking fuel away from people as they attempt to fuel their vehicles.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Okay, so we are through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. So let’s pause a moment to savor the irony here. The very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working class Canadians who are trying to stay alive in arctic temperatures. As they used to say in the 1960s, scratch a liberal and you will find a fascist. That was a Black Panther slogan actually. They weren’t entirely stupid. In fact in this case, they were absolutely right.According to Justin Trudeau, possessing gasoline in the City of Ottawa is now a crime. Now, to be clear, Ottawa didn’t declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire, shot someone or leveled a church, BLM did all of those things, but Justin Trudeau strongly supports BLM. He reaffirmed his support the other day.Here is the problem, and we’re going to let the mayor of Ottawa or Ottawa as it is correctly pronounced Jibowu (ph) explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to Canada.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JIM WATSON, OTTAWA, CANADA: It’s disturbing when you see the protests turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival where they’ve got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows a great deal of insensitivity.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: They’ve got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of Ottawa. Let’s hurt them.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a dark scene in Truckistan tonight. The kids are on the bouncy castles. Of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime.Watch this protester, a white supremacist explain his motives for protest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where the hell were you? You weren’t there. But, now you want to come out in the freezing cold to oppose my fundamental human rights and freedoms.I’m not going to have it. I’m a Black man standing beside my brother right here. This is my brother right here and none of you have the right to tell me who to associate with and who not to associate with me because you did not come out and voice your concerns for the fact that Justin Trudeau banned me from leaving this country because of my medical decision, because I made a decision that he did not like.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Shut up, racist. Go back to Jamaica with your white supremacy nonsense.By the way, no one in Canada’s government or the media in Canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. Instead, they’ve gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. They don’t have an argument to make, all they have is police power and they’re using them.Officials in Ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the California company, GoFundMe because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. Here is Ottawa’s Police Chief bragging about stealing that money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHIEF PETER SLOLY, OTTAWA POLICE: We have, through the efforts of Deputy Bell, Christian Henow (ph), the mayor and his staff, we’ve been able to shut down the GoFundMe program. That’s a temporary reprieve because the funds are already moving in different directions.We are now going after supply and fuel coming into the area through investigations and intelligence operations and interdictions, all of which were underway yesterday, fully underway today.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Intelligence operations? This is a peaceful, political protest. No one has shown any evidence to the contrary. It’s not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. It’s not al-Qaeda. These are Canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they’re being treated like a terror group.GoFundMe announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably BLM, which it has supported since the very beginning. In other words, GoFundMe plan to steal that money.They were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of American Attorneys General who threatened to sue the companies. So the company backed off and they’re going to refund the money, supposedly. But still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it.So, in the absence of GoFundMe doing what it’s supposed to do, others are filling the gap. An alternative crowdfunding website called GiveSendGo has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. How long until they try to shut that down, too?Some Canadians are clearly worried about that. They’re turning to cryptocurrency. Tally Coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It’s not controlled by banks. That’s the point. They’re hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don’t control crypto.Bitcoin goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.It’s pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they’ll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.Either way, it’s becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold, the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. That doesn’t apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. You can’t organize if you can’t talk to other people.So Facebook, for example, just shut down the “Convoy to D.C. Group,” which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. No one is allowed to promote the organization anymore. Facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in Canada. Of course, they are. That seems like a story, but our media have ignored it.Instead, everyone in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with Silicon Valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. It makes sense.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Those with the so-called freedom convoy say they’re staying put until vaccine mandates are dropped, the masks come off, and life returns to the way it was.JAMES MACDONALD, PROTESTER: This whole event has gone beyond just vaccines and it is now about the entire ordeal.SUZANNE AND PAUL, PROTESTERS: We’re asking for our freedom. That’s all we want.NEWTON: So, they’ve been free, free to park big rigs right next to the Prime Minister’s Office, free to set up camp in front of the country’s National Parliament. Ottawa Police say they have learned much in the past week, especially after reports of assaults, intimidation and allegations of hate speech and symbols.SLOLY: This remains, as it was from the beginning, an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration.NEWTON: And it is spreading like a contagion itself right across the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It’s spreading like a contagion. Now, you knew that CNN was the Praetorian Guard for our ruling class. Did you know they serve the same role in Canada and what other countries? How much money does CNN take from the government of Canada? That’d be worth finding out.They described what’s happening in Ottawa as a, quote: “violent and dangerous demonstration.” Really? Where is the violence coming from? The only people getting injured or have been injured so far are the protesters, the truckers.In Winnipeg on Friday, an anarchist called David Zegarac drove his jeep into four people who were protesting vaccine mandates. You’re seeing that on the screen right now.Zegarac didn’t stop after hitting the people, he fled. Police shortly, they arrested him. Of course, police are treating the incident like a hit and run. Nothing political. It’s not domestic terrorism or anything. David Zegarac, his views, they agree with. He’s a progressive, a true believer. How much is he a true believer?Well, if you look closely, you’ll notice that Zegarac has his mask on driving alone in his car during the assault, prima facie evidence of mental illness, something you see in this country all the time, and it makes you wonder: If you’re driving alone with a mask on, do you pose a danger to pedestrians? Entirely possible. Someone should fund a study on that. That seems like a big story, especially since it’s happening just an hour from our own border, all of this.The question is: How long before protests like this come here? Clearly, our media are worried about that. Watch the morning news anchors on MSNBC. They’re deeply, deeply concerned about these uppity working-class people. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Where were these protests when people were required to give their children five vaccines?MIKE BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: They were in the doctor’s office getting vaccines.SCARBOROUGH: They were in the doctor’s office getting vaccines and they were making fun of left-wingers on the West Coast for being loopy anti- vaxxers. Now, they have met the enemy and the enemy, their enemy, is themselves because they’ve become what they hated. It’s a cult.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So here you have Joe and Mika sneering from their studio in Florida at the freezing wage earners stuck outside in Ottawa in February because they want their human rights. Screw them.Will Joe Scarborough say that to their faces? Probably not.Scarborough is famously tough on young female employees. Some say he’s an absolute killer in the office, but it’s hard to imagine Scarborough talking like this if there was an actual Canadian trucker in the room.Truckers in this country are watching all of this, and you wonder: What do they think about it? What would happen if American truck drivers decided they’d had enough of people like Joe Scarborough and went on strike? What would happen then?Well, this country would stop immediately, no more deliveries of anything. Over time that would mean starvation for people in the cities, but even in the short term, there would be profound suffering in this country.For example, and this is something that too few people outside of television even consider, the world’s entire supply of Botox is manufactured on the West Coast of Ireland. That’s a long way from here. In fact, it’s a 4,000 mile long supply chain from the Allergan plant in Westport, Ireland to Jupiter, Florida.Now, people at MSNBC might not be aware of this, but our country has no domestic Botox production, along with Vitamin C, and antibiotics. It’s one of the lifesaving pharmaceutical products we have recklessly offshored.So if the trucks stop delivering, the Botox stops coming and suddenly your morning television anchors are going to look like they’re 58 years old, which actually they are.Could that happen? Is it impossible? No, it’s not impossible. The people in charge aren’t really thinking this through. Most of the time, trends start in the United States and they move north to Canada, but this time, the opposite could happen.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/02/09/hysterical-left-on-peaceful-canadian-freedom-convoy-occupation-siege-terrorism/,"OTTAWA, Ontario – Canadian leftists this week began using war terms  such as “occupation,” “siege,” and “terrorism” to describe the ongoing Freedom Convoy demonstration in Ottawa, alongside calls inviting authorities to consider the use of military intervention to end the protest.During an “emergency debate” in the House of Commons on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said demonstrators in Canada’s capital city “are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy, and our fellow citizens’ daily lives.” He framed the demonstrations as characterized by Nazi symbolism and confederate flags.“The people of Ottawa don’t deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods,” he added. “They don’t deserve to be confronted with the inherent violence of a swastika flying on a street corner, or a Confederate flag, or the insults and jeers just because they’re wearing a mask.”Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino said Ottawans are being “held hostage” by the Freedom Convoy. He accused the demonstration of manifesting widespread criminal intimidation and violence.“Many [Ottawans], especially young women, feel unsafe,” Mendicino claimed. “They’ve been blockaded by an angry, loud, intolerant, and often violent crowd. … Peaceful protests do not make people afraid to leave their homes, and this convoy has done that, and in doing so it has crossed the line.”He described the demonstration as lawless. He said, “We are doing what we can to end this convoy and reestablish law and order in Ottawa.” Mendicino said swastikas and Confederate flags were common among Freedom Convoy demonstrators.“The flying of Confederate flags [and] the demonstration of swastikas … are not isolated incidents,” he alleged. “It has been rampant.”“The people of Ottawa are under siege,” communist New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said during the House of Commons debate. He added, “This convoy protest is not a peaceful protest.” He described the demonstration as a display of “lawlessness, “mob rule,” and “occupation.” He accused demonstrators of “harassing” Ottawans.“The convoy’s been about hateful symbols,” he claimed, “like a Nazi flag and the Confederate flag.”Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has publicly used the terms “occupy” and “occupation” dozens of times across the duration of the protest. He praised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for considering the use of “additional resources” to “put an end to the ongoing occupation in Ottawa’s downtown core.”I want to thank @JustinTrudeau @BillBlair @marcomendicino for the constructive discussions this afternoon on the next steps we need to take together, including the commitment of additional resources, to put an end to the ongoing occupation in Ottawa’s downtown core.— Jim Watson (@JimWatsonOttawa) February 8, 2022Watson described the sight of children playing in bouncy castles amid the Freedom Convoy demonstration as “disturbing” in an interview with CTV News on Sunday.Diane Deans, an Ottawa city councilor who announced her bid for the city’s mayorship, labeled the Freedom Convoy a “nationwide insurrection” and “threat to our democracy” during a “special meeting” conducted via Zoom with local authorities on Saturday. She said demonstrators are “terrorizing” Ottawa residents.“We cannot allow this kind of terrorism in our community to continue in this way,” she remarked.Ottawa city councillor Diane Deans calls the peaceful Freedom Convoy a “nationwide insurrection” and a “threat to our democracy.” pic.twitter.com/gr9fiAaD2O— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) February 6, 2022On Tuesday, Ottawa Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell described the demonstration as an “unlawful occupation” during a “virtual press conference.” He characterized the protesters as “highly determined and volatile.”“Our message to demonstrators remains the same,” he concluded while delivering prepared remarks, “don’t come, and if you do, there will be consequences, including financial consequences for your illegal and unlawful behavior.”CTV News asked Ottawa’s mayor about a military option to end the protest. “What options do we have right now?” CTV’s Katie Griffin asked. “Are you at the point where you have to request the military to come in?”Many Canadian news media outlets have openly inquired about the use of military personnel in response to the Freedom Convoy. The Toronto Star published an article entitled, “Call in the army? Here’s how the military could end the truckers’ protest.” The Globe and Mail similarly considered the use of military forces to end the demonstration in a column entitled, “How Canadian law allows for military assistance in ending the Ottawa occupation.”The Globe and Mail further called the Freedom Convoy “sedition” in an op-ed."
https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2022/02/09/freedom-convoy-triumphs-as-canadian-mandates-fall/,"Canada’s Freedom Convoy trucker protest against vaccine mandates continued on Tuesday as mandates, vaccine passport systems, and other coronavirus restrictions began falling in provinces across the country – including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island.Premier Jason Kenney of Alberta, scene of a vigorous Freedom Convoy protest at a vital border crossing with the United States, announced the end of its vaccine passports on Tuesday in a remorseful news conference that described pandemic restrictions as a source of “terrible division.”“Now is the time to begin learning to live with [Chinese coronavirus],” Kenney said on Tuesday. “We cannot remain at a heightened state of emergency forever. We have to begin to heal.”“The threat of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to public health no longer outweighs the hugely damaging impact of health restrictions. We are well positioned to live with this virus,” he said, citing reduced hospitalization and encouraging wastewater analysis as reasons to begin easing pandemic rules.In truth, the number of hospitalizations in Alberta is fairly steady, as the Globe and Mail pointed out – with some implied skepticism about Kenney’s insistence that the massive Freedom Convoy protests had nothing to do with his sudden realization that pandemic restrictions have outlived their usefulness.Hundreds of truck drivers and their supporters block the streets of downtown Ottawa as part of a convoy of protesters against COVID-19 mandates in Canada on February 09, 2022 in Ottawa, Ontario. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)“The program is no longer serving a useful and compelling purpose,” Kenney said of vaccine passports. “I could not stand in front of Albertans tonight and justify a continuation of a program that has done its job.”“None of that has to do anything with a few trucks parked at the Coutts border crossing,” he added.Supporters gather at Parliament Hill for the Freedom Truck Convoy in Ottawa, Canada, on January 29, 2022. (LARS HAGBERG/AFP via Getty Images)Kenney said restrictions would be lifted in three stages, beginning with the termination of vaccine passports at midnight and the end of pandemic policies in schools, including the odious mask mandate on young children.“It is time to let kids be kids,” Kenney said.Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said his own province’s vaccine passport system would be eliminated on Valentine’s Day, while indoor masking requirements would be lifted at the end of February.Protestors of the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walk near Parliament Hill on February 5, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/left-blames-trump-americans-for-canadas-freedom-convoy/,"Canadian leftists and corporate media this week have begun denouncing the “Freedom Convoy” – a trucker-led protest against civil rights abuses in the name of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic – by associating it with former President Donald Trump, the “alt-right,” and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.In reality, the “Freedom Convoy” movement refers to a series of protests in which truckers – who have been most onerously affected by interprovincial vaccine mandates and other coronavirus-related edicts – have used their vehicles to occupy cities and border crossings. The largest such protest is in Ottawa, the national capital, where thousands have convened to demand the federal government lift mandates. The main form of protest in Ottawa has been honking truck horns, resulting in a court injunction banning the use of car horns.Despite the overwhelming numbers of protesters in Ottawa – and Toronto, Quebec, Vancouver, and crossings all along the southern border – police have reported very few incidents of violence, some of them directly caused by police.The Canadian left has begun to accuse the domestic movement of being associated with President Trump, disregarding his effusive campaign for vaccination and his role in implementing the first wave of lockdowns in the United States, as well as elevating celebrity doctor Anthony Fauci to household name status. At the top of the list of accusers is the head of the radical leftist New Democratic Party, Fidel Castro sympathizer Jagmeet Singh, who has attributed the popularity and success of the “Freedom Convoy” to “Trumpism” and “foreign actors,” without evidence.“The spread of Trumpism into Canada must be stopped,” Singh declared on Twitter, encouraging followers to join his campaign to “shut down U.S. interference” within the convoy. His party’s website blames, among others, Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Fox News, and the “alt-right” – a term popularized in the 2016 election and largely out of use to describe any political group today – for Canadian anti-mandate protests.“It is time for national leadership – the federal government must contact the US administration to shut down funding coming from the US,” the New Democrats declare. “Add your name to protect our democracy by shutting down the flow of foreign funding coming from the US.”Writing at the Globe and Mail on Tuesday, columnist Gary Mason adopted Singh’s terminology and branded the Canadian civil rights protesters with the 2016 terminology “alt-right,” describing the entire concept of “freedom” as having been hijacked by extremists and no longer legitimate.“Freedom, as an ideology, has been appropriated by the Make America Great Again (MAGA) wing of the U.S. Republican party. There is a strong MAGA fan base in this country, apparently with prominent supporters such as Candice Bergen, the new interim leader of the federal Conservative Party of Canada,” Mason lamented. “Undated photos circulating on social media appear to show Ms. Bergen sporting a camouflage MAGA hat.”“The word ‘freedom’ could be found on most signs being touted by the protesters. For many, it’s a word that has become code for white-identity politics and the far-right’s weapon of choice in the culture wars,” Mason asserted.A similar column published last week by the Edmonton Journal compared the protests to the January 6 incident, which had no ties to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.“It became clear early on that the convoy’s leadership was a partisan mix of anti-science, anti-vax, libertarian cranks, with a wholly overblown sense of their importance,” the column read. “Calling for a Jan. 6-like overthrow of the Canadian government, issuing pretentious twaddle in the form of demands, and carrying around Nazi or Confederate flags will not — fortunately — win the hearts and minds of most Canadians.”The Washington Post also seized on calling the trucker convoys “Trumpian” on Tuesday.“Canada is becoming an unlikely symbol of the radicalization of the anti-vaccination movement in the West that shares more than a few similarities with the militancy of Trump Republicans,” the Jeff Bezos-owned publication claimed. “Parallels to the Jan. 6 insurrection may be limited in Ottawa — protesters are not knocking down the doors of Parliament. But anti-government slogans flooding Ottawa’s streets suggest similar grievances, even as their trucks serve as a flashback to the Trump caravans that menaced U.S. highways during the 2020 campaign.”The comparisons omit Trump’s own history with coronavirus mandates, initially imposing the “two weeks to slow the spread” lockdown campaign and extending restrictions beyond Easter 2020 when he had promised the American people they would end. As president, Trump held daily televised events with Fauci and other public health officials, granting them a nearly unparalleled platform to impose their views, which align with the opponents of the “Freedom Convoy.” Trump eventually spoke out against vaccine and mask mandates as they became politically unpalatable among conservatives.More recently, Trump claimed that he had personally “developed the vaccine,” boasted about receiving a booster vaccine product dose, and has enthusiastically urged supporters to do the same."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/let-him-answer-hes-not-good-at-it-heckling-silences-justin-trudeau-in-canadian-parliament/,"Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced jeers and insults in Parliament on Tuesday as he once again faced questions regarding his derision towards citizens who oppose civil rights violations tied to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.Trudeau had a contentious week in Parliament after vanishing from the public eye to an undisclosed site in late January, allegedly to recover from a Chinese coronavirus infection himself. He returned on Monday to an emergency session discussing the “Freedom Convoy,” a series of protests led by truckers demanding an end to vaccine and mask mandates, business lockdowns, and travel restrictions that the Trudeau government has imposed in an attempt to contain the pandemic.The largest iteration of the convoy is currently in downtown Ottawa, not far from Parliament. The city has been flooded by trucks for nearly two weeks and attracted thousands of protesters – most of whom, according to police, have been peaceful. Reports on the ground have revealed the development of a community among the protesters including distribution of free food, drinks, and other supplies and a generally positive party atmosphere, save for instances of police brutality.Trudeau has repeatedly insisted he would not listen to any calls for lifting the mandates and restoring normal life to Canada. He has accused the protesters of racism and misogyny and equated them with Nazis in his statements in Parliament on Monday.The next day, he once again faced calls to meet with opposition leaders and bring an end to the onerous mandate regime currently in place. The interim leader of the Conservative Party, Candice Bergen, asked Trudeau if he would consider ending restrictions once again.“This cannot be a slow and dragged out process simply because of the prime minister’s ego, pride, or denial,” Bergen said. “Canadians are too tired. Canadians need hope. So will the prime minister follow the science, follow the evidence, end the restrictions, end the mandates?”OTTAWA, ON – FEBRUARY 05: A “Where’s Trudeau” sign is seen near Parliament Hill on February 5, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. Truckers continue their rally over the weekend near Parliament Hill in hopes of pressuring the government to roll back COVID-19 public health regulations and mandates. (Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)Trudeau did not answer the question, instead asserting, amid heckling and jeers, “we’re going to continue to follow the science, we’re going to continue to have Canadians’ backs, we’re going to continue to protect people’s lives.”Bergen again asked him to answer the question, but upon his second attempt, the jeering became so loud that he stopped abruptly and sat down to wait for it to end. Amid the shouting, one voice could be heard saying, “Let him answer, he’s not good at it!”Speaker of the House of Commons Anthony Rota admonished the chamber and confirmed that the shouting was, indeed, jeers.“The honorable leader of the opposition asked a question and she’s trying to hear, but she can’t hear it above all the heckling and shouting that’s going on,” Rota scolded.The speaker did not succeed in silencing the shouting entirely but diminished it enough for Trudeau to finish his response, which was nearly identical to his first statement.Trudeau and Bergen have engaged in several testy exchanges since she assumed the leadership of the Conservative Party following the ouster of predecessor Erin O’Toole last week. On Monday, Bergen pressed Trudeau for an apology for his invective against those who choose not to receive a Chinese coronavirus vaccine.“Does he regret calling people names who didn’t take the vaccine?” Bergen asked of Trudeau. “Does he regret calling people misogynist and racist and just, escalating and poking sticks at them and being so divisive to individual Canadians that he might not disagree with, that he might have thought were wrong?”Trudeau responded by associating the protesters with Nazis.A protester holds up a sign condemning the vaccine mandates introduced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier François Legault. (Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)“A few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,” Trudeau said.The prime minister has repeatedly referred to protesters, and any individual who does not agree with mandates regardless of participation, in similar terms. In remarks from his undisclosed location last week, Trudeau accused the protesters of wearing “tinfoil hats” and compared them unfavorably to the violent riots fueled by the “Black Lives Matter” movement in 2020. Trudeau met with members of that movement and kneeled before them at the time.“I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agree with the goals, [and] when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues. Black Lives Matter is an excellent example of that,” Trudeau told reporters. “But I have also chosen to not go anywhere near protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric, violence towards fellow citizens.”“The concerns expressed by a few people gathered in Ottawa, right now, are not new, not surprising, are heard, but are a continuation of what we’ve unfortunately seen in disinformation and misinformation,” Trudeau asserted, equating demonstrators’ concerns with “online conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats.”Trudeau’s long absence amid what opponents of the protest movement have called a crisis and occupation has prompted criticism of the prime minister from his left, accusing him of leaving a “leadership void” that has allowed the protests to grow.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/hysterical-left-on-peaceful-canadian-freedom-convoy-occupation-siege-terrorism/,"OTTAWA, Ontario – Canadian leftists this week began using war terms  such as “occupation,” “siege,” and “terrorism” to describe the ongoing Freedom Convoy demonstration in Ottawa, alongside calls inviting authorities to consider the use of military intervention to end the protest.During an “emergency debate” in the House of Commons on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said demonstrators in Canada’s capital city “are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy, and our fellow citizens’ daily lives.” He framed the demonstrations as characterized by Nazi symbolism and confederate flags.“The people of Ottawa don’t deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods,” he added. “They don’t deserve to be confronted with the inherent violence of a swastika flying on a street corner, or a Confederate flag, or the insults and jeers just because they’re wearing a mask.”Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino said Ottawans are being “held hostage” by the Freedom Convoy. He accused the demonstration of manifesting widespread criminal intimidation and violence.“Many [Ottawans], especially young women, feel unsafe,” Mendicino claimed. “They’ve been blockaded by an angry, loud, intolerant, and often violent crowd. … Peaceful protests do not make people afraid to leave their homes, and this convoy has done that, and in doing so it has crossed the line.”He described the demonstration as lawless. He said, “We are doing what we can to end this convoy and reestablish law and order in Ottawa.” Mendicino said swastikas and Confederate flags were common among Freedom Convoy demonstrators.“The flying of Confederate flags [and] the demonstration of swastikas … are not isolated incidents,” he alleged. “It has been rampant.”“The people of Ottawa are under siege,” communist New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said during the House of Commons debate. He added, “This convoy protest is not a peaceful protest.” He described the demonstration as a display of “lawlessness, “mob rule,” and “occupation.” He accused demonstrators of “harassing” Ottawans.“The convoy’s been about hateful symbols,” he claimed, “like a Nazi flag and the Confederate flag.”Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has publicly used the terms “occupy” and “occupation” dozens of times across the duration of the protest. He praised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for considering the use of “additional resources” to “put an end to the ongoing occupation in Ottawa’s downtown core.”I want to thank @JustinTrudeau @BillBlair @marcomendicino for the constructive discussions this afternoon on the next steps we need to take together, including the commitment of additional resources, to put an end to the ongoing occupation in Ottawa’s downtown core.— Jim Watson (@JimWatsonOttawa) February 8, 2022Watson described the sight of children playing in bouncy castles amid the Freedom Convoy demonstration as “disturbing” in an interview with CTV News on Sunday.Diane Deans, an Ottawa city councilor who announced her bid for the city’s mayorship, labeled the Freedom Convoy a “nationwide insurrection” and “threat to our democracy” during a “special meeting” conducted via Zoom with local authorities on Saturday. She said demonstrators are “terrorizing” Ottawa residents.“We cannot allow this kind of terrorism in our community to continue in this way,” she remarked.Ottawa city councillor Diane Deans calls the peaceful Freedom Convoy a “nationwide insurrection” and a “threat to our democracy.” pic.twitter.com/gr9fiAaD2O— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) February 6, 2022On Tuesday, Ottawa Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell described the demonstration as an “unlawful occupation” during a “virtual press conference.” He characterized the protesters as “highly determined and volatile.”“Our message to demonstrators remains the same,” he concluded while delivering prepared remarks, “don’t come, and if you do, there will be consequences, including financial consequences for your illegal and unlawful behavior.”CTV News asked Ottawa’s mayor about a military option to end the protest. “What options do we have right now?” CTV’s Katie Griffin asked. “Are you at the point where you have to request the military to come in?”Many Canadian news media outlets have openly inquired about the use of military personnel in response to the Freedom Convoy. The Toronto Star published an article entitled, “Call in the army? Here’s how the military could end the truckers’ protest.” The Globe and Mail similarly considered the use of military forces to end the demonstration in a column entitled, “How Canadian law allows for military assistance in ending the Ottawa occupation.”The Globe and Mail further called the Freedom Convoy “sedition” in an op-ed."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/texas-ag-ken-paxton-launches-investigation-into-gofundme/,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) announced Wednesday that his officer has opened an investigation into GoFundMe following the crowdfunding platform’s decision to shut down a fundraising effort aimed at assisting the “Freedom Convey” in Canada.Paxton said that he issued a Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to GoFundMe to review possible breaches or violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) after it closed nearly $10-million fundraising campaign for the “Freedom Convoy,” which have protested in Ottawa and other major Canadian cities against the country’s coronavirus vaccine mandates Initially, GoFundMe planned to re-direct the funds to other charities, but opted to refund the donations amid fierce backlash from conservatives.Paxton said in a statement:GoFundMe’s response to an anti-mandate, pro-liberty movement should ring alarm bells to anyone using the donation platform and, more broadly, any American wanting to protect their constitutional rights. Many Texans donated to this worthy cause. I am acting to protect Texas consumers so that they know where their hard-earned money is going, rather than allowing GoFundMe to divert money to another cause without the consent of Texas citizens. I will get to the bottom of this deceitful action.Paxton isn’t the only high-profile Texas Republican who has sought clarity on GoFundMe’s decisions regarding the campaign supporting the “Freedom Convoy.”Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation into the platform for potential wrongdoing.“It is theft on the part of GoFundMe. The Canadian truckers are heroes, patriots, and they are marching for your freedom and for my freedom. Those truck drivers, god bless them, that are defending Canada, are defending America as well. That is courage on display,” Cruz told Fox News. “I sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asking that the FTC open an investigation into GoFundMe into whether they’ve committed deceptive trade practices. Because when people gave money, they gave money under the promise it would go to the Freedom Convoy, not to whatever left-wing political ideology GoFundMe and other Silicon Valley companies support.”"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/ottawa-tow-truck-companies-refuse-haul-away-freedom-convoy-trucks/,"Every tow truck company that has a municipal contract has refused to haul away the Freedom Convoy trucks that have blocked city streets in the Canadian capital for the past two weeks, Ottawa City Manager Steve Kanellakos said Tuesday.Ottawa declared a state of emergency over the protests on Sunday, with Mayor Jim Watson describing the truckers and their supporters as a threat to the “safety and security of residents.”The state of emergency led to speculation that Ottawa, and perhaps other city governments, might break up the protests by towing the trucks away. Commentators with knowledge of the towing industry suggested its drivers might be reluctant to take action against their fellow truckers, and even if they did agree to haul away Freedom Convoy trucks, the process of towing big rigs is far more complex and time-consuming than towing private motor vehicles – especially if the truck driver does not cooperate.Kanellakos said Ottawa has contracts with ten towing companies, covering everything from enforcement of parking regulations to rescuing city vehicles.A person carries a fuel can on Wellington street as demonstrators continue to protest the Covid-19 vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 9, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)“We’ve contacted them all and every one, they’re all refusing as of today to provide heavy tow truck work,” he said after briefing the city council on the situation. He added that the towing companies were still providing services for normal-sized vehicles.Kanellakos said the “consensus” among towing companies “seems to be that they don’t want to do the work because the heavy truck industry is such a large part of their livelihoods and they don’t want to damage that part of their businesses,” as reported by Canada’s Globe and Mail.Covid-19 mandate protesters block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing with the U.S., in Windsor, Ontario, on February 9, 2022. (GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty Images)A towing company CEO told the Globe and Mail he was concerned for the safety of his employees and future of his company if he instructed his drivers to intervene in the protests, because “nobody is going to have my back.”A similar situation exists at the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, which has been blocked by protesting truckers, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).“From the onset of this event, we actively engaged towing companies to assist. Unfortunately, they were unwilling to become involved when it was implied that helping law enforcement with removal would likely damage their livelihoods into the future,” said RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki at a news conference on Tuesday.Zablocki said it would be a severe “challenge” for the RCMP to move protesters’ trucks without the assistance of commercial towing services, since the police do not have access to the “heavy equipment” required. He said the RCMP has nevertheless been able to reduce the number of trucks blocking the Coutts crossing from 250 to about 50.“They need to recognize that this protest is not lawful. We’re confident that charges will be laid,” he said.Ottawa appears to be looking for a new angle to use against the Freedom Convoy truckers, as the Canadian Press on Tuesday quoted Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell noticing that “a quarter of the 418 trucks still camped out in the city’s downtown have children in them.”“We’re concerned about access to sanitation, the ability to shower,” Bell said. “There’s a multitude of concerns. That’s why we’re raising it and identifying it as something that we need to address. We need to have discussions with our partners and the children’s aid society about how we manage moving ahead.”This burst of concern for the children of protesters is a little difficult to reconcile with the current police strategy of pressuring the truckers to leave by denying them access to fuel, since trucks without fuel cannot run their heaters, and nighttime temperatures in Ottawa are projected to fall below zero over the weekend.The fuel ban is not working well anyway, as the National Post on Tuesday reported hordes of protest supporters are marching around downtown Ottawa brandishing fuel containers that are either empty or filled with water, making it very difficult for the police to determine which containers might actually have fuel in them.After the “fuel ban” it is now illegal to bring gas cans to the Freedom Convoy Peaceful Protest — here is what the streets of Ottawa looked like tonight. God bless these people 🙏🏻😂 pic.twitter.com/kswVn4vtVS— Benny (@bennyjohnson) February 9, 2022“It does provide a layer of logistical complexity to us,” Deputy Police Chief Bell admitted.At the same press conference, Bell said some of the protesters have removed the wheels from their vehicles, while truckers have employed various methods to “immobilize” their rigs, making the protest blockades hard to clear."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/freedom-convoy-triumphs-as-canadian-mandates-fall/,"Canada’s Freedom Convoy trucker protest against vaccine mandates continued on Tuesday as mandates, vaccine passport systems, and other coronavirus restrictions began falling in provinces across the country – including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island.Premier Jason Kenney of Alberta, scene of a vigorous Freedom Convoy protest at a vital border crossing with the United States, announced the end of its vaccine passports on Tuesday in a remorseful news conference that described pandemic restrictions as a source of “terrible division.”“Now is the time to begin learning to live with [Chinese coronavirus],” Kenney said on Tuesday. “We cannot remain at a heightened state of emergency forever. We have to begin to heal.”“The threat of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to public health no longer outweighs the hugely damaging impact of health restrictions. We are well positioned to live with this virus,” he said, citing reduced hospitalization and encouraging wastewater analysis as reasons to begin easing pandemic rules.In truth, the number of hospitalizations in Alberta is fairly steady, as the Globe and Mail pointed out – with some implied skepticism about Kenney’s insistence that the massive Freedom Convoy protests had nothing to do with his sudden realization that pandemic restrictions have outlived their usefulness.Hundreds of truck drivers and their supporters block the streets of downtown Ottawa as part of a convoy of protesters against COVID-19 mandates in Canada on February 09, 2022 in Ottawa, Ontario.

Their behavior has been nothing short of thuggish in Ottawa. They kept people in the neighborhood awake all night, revving their engines, blowing their horns. They’ve deprived Ottawa of business, of tens of millions of dollars, now they’re blockading the international bridges.”He continued, “They’re laying off people, cutting their shifts short in automotive assembly plants because they can’t get the parts from Canada to the United States. They used their crowbars to threaten cops who were going to tow their trucks away they were blocking. They told tow truck drivers that they’ll remember them when this is over, a clear intimidation tactic. To give these guys the mantle of freedom fighters is absolutely appallingly naïve.”Rivera added, “I understand the frustration about masks and all the rest of it, but to give these folks a pass is, I think, very destructive.”He concluded, “When you have protesters bringing Confederate flags and Swastikas and to paint them in the same portrait as our Founding Fathers? What the hell is that about? They have been very destructive. Forty percent of Canada’s trade goes over the Ambassador Bridge that they have blocked. What about the hard-working people that have gone to work every day during this pandemic and now can’t get to work? Or can’t work because there’s no parts in their factory to work with?

https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2022/02/09/canadian-truckers-intensify-blockade-of-top-u-s-canada-border-crossing/,"The Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Ontario, which closed overnight on Monday and reopened to slow-moving traffic on Tuesday, was once again blocked by protesting Canadian truck drivers on Wednesday. The bridge is part of the busiest and most commercially valuable border crossing between Canada and the United States, so it has become a pivotal scene in the Freedom Convoy saga.The Detroit News quoted growing concern on both sides of the border about the economic impact of the Ambassador Bridge blockade:“Any delay or disruption in the supply chain creates problems, not just for agriculture but the state economy,” said Chuck Lippstreu, president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association, which represents businesses that support farmers, early in the closure.The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, which represents the Detroit Three automakers, called for an end to the protest, citing its effect on the country’s economy.“Auto production relies on efficient supply chain logistics for delivery of parts, components and vehicles,” the association said in a statement Tuesday. “Persistent delays at the Ambassador Bridge risk disrupting automotive production that employs tens of thousands of Canadians.”Overflow traffic is beginning to clog alternate routes like the Blue Water Bridge, where personal and commercial traffic is now backed up for miles, with wait times to cross the bridge exceeding four and a half hours on Wednesday morning:Currently on I-94 E heading toward the Blue Water Bridge…Truck traffic is moving at a snail’s pace.

This is really a serious cause for concern,” Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra told the BBC on Tuesday.“The disruption of the Ambassador Bridge is an attack on the well-being of our citizens and the businesses that employ them. As our economies emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, we cannot allow any group to undermine the cross-border trade that supports families on both sides of the border,” a coalition of U.S. and Canadian businesses said in a statement released on Tuesday night.Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens and Police Chief Pam Mizuno held a press conference on Wednesday in which they said about a hundred protesters are blocking the bridge with 50 to 75 vehicles.“You have a number of people who are on the ground here in the protest group that have outwardly stated that this cause is so passionate for them, they feel such a passion for this particular cause, that they’re willing to die for it. I think one can appreciate that if you have people that hold that sentiment, the situation can escalate to become very dangerous for police and those members of the public in very short order,” Dilkens said.Windsor police officials described the demonstrators as mostly “cordial” but determined. Dilkens and Mizuno said additional officers, police vehicles, and intelligence support for the Ambassador Bridge had been requested from the provincial and national governments.“Action will have to be taken to open this bridge,” a frustrated Dilkens said.“I’ll be brutally honest: You are trying to have a rational conversation and not everyone on the ground is a rational actor,” he said. “Police are doing what is right by taking a moderate approach, trying to sensibly work through this situation where everyone can walk away, nobody gets hurt, and the bridge can open.”Windsor police would not discuss their plan to reopen the bridge with reporters, insisting their department “respects the rights of Canadians to exercise their freedom of expression and peacefully assemble” and pledging to maintain “open communications” with protest organizers."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/canadian-truckers-intensify-blockade-of-top-u-s-canada-border-crossing/,"The Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Ontario, which closed overnight on Monday and reopened to slow-moving traffic on Tuesday, was once again blocked by protesting Canadian truck drivers on Wednesday. The bridge is part of the busiest and most commercially valuable border crossing between Canada and the United States, so it has become a pivotal scene in the Freedom Convoy saga.The Detroit News quoted growing concern on both sides of the border about the economic impact of the Ambassador Bridge blockade:“Any delay or disruption in the supply chain creates problems, not just for agriculture but the state economy,” said Chuck Lippstreu, president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association, which represents businesses that support farmers, early in the closure.The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, which represents the Detroit Three automakers, called for an end to the protest, citing its effect on the country’s economy.“Auto production relies on efficient supply chain logistics for delivery of parts, components and vehicles,” the association said in a statement Tuesday. “Persistent delays at the Ambassador Bridge risk disrupting automotive production that employs tens of thousands of Canadians.”Overflow traffic is beginning to clog alternate routes like the Blue Water Bridge, where personal and commercial traffic is now backed up for miles, with wait times to cross the bridge exceeding four and a half hours on Wednesday morning:Currently on I-94 E heading toward the Blue Water Bridge…Truck traffic is moving at a snail’s pace. It’s due to the Ambassador Bridge partial closure. Drivers are trying to enter Canada from Port Huron. @FOX2News pic.twitter.com/hHeLH8ZlBl— Brandon Hudson (@BHudTV) February 9, 2022“I’ve already heard from automakers and food grocers. This is really a serious cause for concern,” Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra told the BBC on Tuesday.“The disruption of the Ambassador Bridge is an attack on the well-being of our citizens and the businesses that employ them. As our economies emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, we cannot allow any group to undermine the cross-border trade that supports families on both sides of the border,” a coalition of U.S. and Canadian businesses said in a statement released on Tuesday night.Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens and Police Chief Pam Mizuno held a press conference on Wednesday in which they said about a hundred protesters are blocking the bridge with 50 to 75 vehicles.“You have a number of people who are on the ground here in the protest group that have outwardly stated that this cause is so passionate for them, they feel such a passion for this particular cause, that they’re willing to die for it. I think one can appreciate that if you have people that hold that sentiment, the situation can escalate to become very dangerous for police and those members of the public in very short order,” Dilkens said.Windsor police officials described the demonstrators as mostly “cordial” but determined.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/09/ottawa-city-councilman-freedom-convoy-protesters-are-well-known-radicals-miscreants/,"Matthew Luloff, an Ottawa City Councilman, told American taxpayer-funded NPR that the “Freedom Convoy” protests against coronavirus-related mandates in the city were fueled by “miscreants” embracing “hate symbols,” which defies on-the-ground reports showing peaceful demonstrations attracting people of all ages.Luloff said the protest had “morphed into something much uglier” than what eyewitness reports had proven, without offering concrete evidence. “When you say ugly, describe that to me,” an NPR host for Morning Edition asked Luloff.“So some of the most well-known radicals in this country have now descended upon the capital,” Luloff said, failing to name any.“Some of them are calling for violence. Some of them are threatening individual politicians. There have been, you know, threats against life and limb. And it’s incredibly discouraging. We’ve seen some hate symbols. We’ve seen flyers distributed that are acutely anti-Semitic,” he said.A person holds a sign reading “Freedom” as truckers and supporters continue to protest against mandates and restrictions related to Covid-19 vaccines in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on February 5, 2022. (Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)“Now, at the same time, there are people within this group that are demonstrating downtown with legitimate concerns, but you don’t have a productive conversation at the business end of a gun or the grill of a semitruck,” Luloff argued.“Among some of the demands by the protesters is that the vaccine mandates end nationwide,” the NPR host asked. “Will the prime minister [Justin Trudeau] give in to these demands?”Luloff blamed Trudeau’s intransigence on the issue — he has steadfastly refused to meet the protesters or address their concerns in any way — on the United States:The prime minister has aligned our vaccination policy with the United States so that cross-border truckers are required to be vaccinated. The United States is our largest trading partner, and it is important that on policy matters like this that we are aligned to ensure the proper flow of goods. And so, essentially, it’s the municipality that is paying for the grievances that these truckers and other miscreants, frankly, have with the federal government.But Breitbart News reporting on the ground in Ottawa painted a much different picture of protesters:News media outlets described a fictional parallel universe divorced from the demonstration’s reality. The Associated Press framed Saturday’s demonstration as marred by swastikas, Confederate flags, and desecrations of war memorials without providing any photographic or video evidence. CTV operatives breathlessly tweeted accusations of protesters taking food from homeless shelters, waving swastikas, and – gasp! – going maskless into a Tim Hortons.[A Breitbart reporter] asked Shanna, who lives near Ottawa and had been to the demonstrations daily since Saturday, to address derisions of protesting Canadians from those in news media and politics.She replied, “Just come down. Come down any day – even on the weekends or on a weekday – look around. You’ll for sure see Canada here. Everybody is here in unity, and there’s all love. I’ve been down here five days trying to find this ‘hate.’ I can’t find it.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with reporters prior to Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill February 8, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada.

https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/02/10/anti-hate-group-head-used-miami-anti-semitic-flyer-to-smear-truckers/,"The head of the Trudeau-funded Canadian Anti-Hate Network (CAHN), spread a picture of an antisemitic flier on social media claiming it to have originated with the Ottawa Freedom Convoy, an anti-mandate protest led by truckers.Bernie Farber, who is listed as the Chair of CAHN on the group’s website, tweeted on Sunday, stating, “Taken by a friend in Ottawa at the Occupation. Apparently in plain sight,” captioning a picture of an antisemitic flier.The picture of the flier, however, was not from the Ottawa trucker protests against vaccine passports, vaccine mandates and Wuhan coronavirus restrictions – it was from an unrelated event in Miami, Florida, and first posted on Twitter on January 23rd. Farber defended the post before ultimately deleting his claims.The failure to fact-check his own claims before going public is particularly concerning given Farber runs an organisation paid by the Canadian government to “[monitor] extreme-right groups, report on their activities and file complaints with law enforcement”, and which has been the main authority originating claims the trucker protest is extremist.Wow Bernie, isn't it incredible that the picture your ""friend in Ottawa at the Occupation"" sent you is identical to the photo posted on Twitter two weeks ago by someone in Miami, right down to the ceramic design in the background? https://t.co/s4Xf3IbFrI pic.twitter.com/OJGEgrariZ— Jonathan Kay (@jonkay) February 6, 2022After being confronted over the picture on Twitter, Farber later deleted the tweet and stated, “Ok for the record a friend from Ottawa told me they saw an antisemitic flyer &sent it to me. I posted it. The photo itself was old and originally from Miami. However, they said they saw the same thing. Since I am not in Ottawa I cannot attest to it.”At the time of going to press, no evidence that anyone at the Ottawa protests had reproduced the offensive Florida poster has surfaced.The post remained up for several hours and caught the attention of Canadian politicians and others who also spread the hoax, including far-left New Democratic Party member of parliament Charlie Angus.“The #ottawaoccupation gang came to Ottawa with swastikas scrawled on Canadian flags. This shit isn’t hidden its right there in the open,” Angus said.Joe Cressy, the chair of the Toronto Board of Health, also spread the picture writing, “Don’t look away. This vile anti-Semitic hate is being distributed in plain sight. It has no place on the streets of Canadian cities. It has no place anywhere.”Members of the media also spread the picture, including Angie Seth, a reporter for broadcaster CTV, which has cited members of CAHN as sources for allegations of far-right extremism among the protests in recent weeks.Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi has claimed anti-lockdown protests in Canada are ""thinly veiled white nationalist"" activities. https://t.co/DacNYCmWDR— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 12, 2021“This is sick,” wrote Kyle Harrietha, who serves as Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Parliamentary Affairs to Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson, a member of the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The Trudeau government has previously funded CAHN with hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in the past, giving the group $268,400 Canadian dollars (£156,466/$211,526) in 2020 “to carry out the monitoring of extreme-right groups, report on their activities and file complaints with law enforcement.”Since the start of the trucker protests known as the Freedom Convoy, Canadian media outlets have extensively cited members of CAHN, including Farber himself, for claims of far-right radicalism among the activists and participants in the protests.Christian-owned funding platform GiveSendGo is hosting a new fundraiser for the Canada Freedom Convoy after its initial fundraiser was shut down by far-left funding platform GoFundMe.  https://t.co/HOqbRYb53k— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 6, 2022“We’re saying that this is a far-right convoy because — from day one — the organizers themselves are part of the far-right movement,” executive director of CAHN Evan Balgord told Canadian broadcaster Global News last week.Canadian politicians and media have previously labelled anti-lockdown protesters as far-right extremists in the past, including former Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi.“Those people at those anti-mask protests, let’s not kid ourselves. They’re not people who [are protesting because they] need to eat.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/10/watch-justin-trudeau-under-fire-faces-second-day-of-insults-heckles-in-canadian-parliament/,"Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau endured a second day of intense heckling, insults, and accusations of prioritizing his political power over the health of citizens on Wednesday in a heated session of Parliament.Trudeau is currently under fire from both the left and right for his handling of the ongoing “Freedom Convoy” protests, which have made their biggest impact in the national capital, Ottawa, but have surfaced in multiple major cities and American border crossings. As of Thursday, truckers are blocking the largest crossing between the two countries – Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario – and have blocked a border crossing in Manitoba. Prior protests had already hampered traffic between Alberta and Montana.Conservatives have condemned Trudeau for dismissing the protesters – who are calling for an end to all coronavirus-related civil rights restrictions – as “racist” and “misogynist,” as well as comparing them to Nazis. Leftists have condemned Trudeau for not doing much to stop the protests other than insulting the protesters, demanding a plan for resolving the crisis that Trudeau has yet to offer.The prime minister made his return to Parliament on Monday after disappearing to an “undisclosed location” at the beginning of the protests, announcing that he had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus. He has yet to enjoy a Parliament session this week that has not erupted in outbursts of disdain towards him – both from conservatives demanding he apologize for his insults towards the protesters and from leftists demanding more federal intervention to end the protests. During one such exchange on Tuesday, an unidentified lawmaker urged the hecklers to stay quiet: “let him answer, he’s not good at it!”Trudeau Heckled in Parliament: ""Let Him Answer, He's Not Good At It!"" pic.twitter.com/9YJUclTrfX— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 9, 2022While Parliament discussion much of the past week centered around the protests, interim Conservative Party leader Candice Bergen began the question and answer session on Wednesday asking about Trudeau’s most recent call to elections in September, which she branded as “unnecessary” and costly. Canadians had gone to the national polls in 2019, and lawmakers recalled that Trudeau had promised not to call elections as the Chinese coronavirus pandemic continued raging.“As British Columbia was burning, Afghanistan was falling, and we were in the fourth wave of the pandemic, the prime minister called an unnecessary, 600 million [Canadian dollars, $474.3 million] election to capitalize on this crisis,” Bergen assailed. “According to a senior liberal MP [member of Parliament], a decision was made to wedge, to divide, and to stigmatize … why would he [Trudeau] do this to a country that is already suffering and deeply damaged by so many of his policies?”Another Conservative lawmaker, Stephen Ellis, accused Trudeau of forcing Canadians out to an election – causing mass gatherings that social distancing enthusiasts condemn – in the name of his personal power.“Last year, an all-party parliament committee urged the prime minister to promise that he wouldn’t call an election,” Ellis recalled. “In fact, at that time, the prime minister himself said he had no interest in calling an election during a pandemic.”“Canadians were misled. Instead of prioritizing the health and safety of Canadians, he forced an election,” Ellis asserted. “This begs the question – why did the prime minister jeopardize the health of Canadians to save his own job?”Trudeau’s government is violating Canadians’ freedoms of speech, expression, assembly, and religion, a demonstrator in Ottawa, ON, told Breitbart News on Wednesday during the Freedom Convoy protest in Canada’s capital city. https://t.co/9OXyP8TBos— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 5, 2022Trudeau’s answers to both questions were similar, claiming that vaccination was popular and that the election was important to drown out anti-mandate voices. In both instances, shouting and heckling from other lawmakers drowned out parts of Trudeau’s answers.The election, he told Bergen, “was an opportunity for Canadians to weigh in on the path forward for our country, on how to continue to fight this pandemic – and what we saw, unfortunately, from the Conservative Party of Canada was a refusal to step up on vaccinations.”Similarly, Trudeau chided the Party to Ellis, claiming that it was a disgrace that some Conservative lawmakers had not submitted to vaccine product doses, but not addressing social distancing concerns regarding the election.The prime minister also refused, once again, to answer a direct question on when federal civil rights violations against individuals in an effort to contain the Chinese coronavirus would end.“Canada has never been so strong and together as we are now,” he replied.Trudeau faced pressure on the left from the head of the New Democratic Party (NDP), communist lawmaker Jagmeet Singh, who has launched a campaign to discredit the “Freedom Convoy” protests as foreign interference by Americans. Singh has accused former President Donald Trump, without evidence, of leading the anti-restriction protests; compared them to the January 6 Capital riot; and accused malicious “foreign actors” of funding the truckers.A mother and her daughter protest on Wellington street as demonstrators continue to protest the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 9, 2022 in Ottawa, Canada. (DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)Singh has also openly accused Trudeau of being absent in leading the country at a time of significant strife.On Wednesday, Singh asked Trudeau if he would contact American officials to stem the alleged flow of American money to the Canadian protesters, to which Trudeau did not directly answer.“We are working with partners at all levels of government,” he answered vaguely.Unlike Singh, Yves-François Blanchet, the leader of the center-left Bloc Québécois, accused Trudeau of needlessly inciting division and anger, a common complaint among the Conservatives. Blanchet observed widespread “malaise with the government’s handling of the pandemic” that he blamed on a “stigmatizing and divisive approach” by Trudeau’s government.“Is it the prime minister who made the decision to divide and stigmatize for his own gain?” Blanchet asked.A person clears ice and snow in front of the Senate of Canada as demonstrators continue to protest the Covid-19 vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 9, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told reporters on Thursday he did not see any immediate end to the protests and had no plans to directly intervene.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."
https://www.breitbart.com/news/growing-trucker-protest-raises-fears-for-canada-economy/,"Trucker-led protests against coronavirus restrictions in Canada shut down another US border crossing Thursday, as copycat movements gathered steam overseas and Washington called on its northern neighbor to use federal powers to end the blockades.The border obstructions have already impacted business, with the key Ambassador Bridge linking Ontario and Detroit out of service for several days — and major automakers forced to cut back production at several plants as a result.A second crossing in the western province of Alberta has been blocked for days, and on Thursday protesters closed down a third — in central Manitoba.Citing supply shortages, Ford said it was forced to slow down production at factories in Canada, while some Stellantis factories in the United States and Canada halted work Wednesday evening, General Motors cancelled several shifts and Toyota said its plants were also hit.In the Canadian capital, police said Thursday they were bringing in reinforcements, issuing more arrests and tickets, and stepping up truck towing operations in a bid to break the impasse that has paralyzed the city.But protesters were hunkering down and taking pride in how their two-week protest has mushroomed into an international movement.“You know it’s really bad if Canadians are coming out full force,” said protester Naomi Gilman, noting how her fellow citizens had largely remained quiet “for two long years” of Covid restrictions.“So I think that resonates around the world for sure,” she told AFP.Addressing reporters outside the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once again called the blockades “unacceptable” and said he was working with authorities across the country to bring them to an end.“This is hurting communities across the country,” Trudeau said.Washington stepped up its pressure too, with the White House saying that US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas “called his Canadian counterparts, urging them to use federal powers to resolve this situation at our joint border.”Despite Trudeau and Washington warning the protests pose an economic threat, rallies inspired by the trucker movement have sprung up elsewhere, from New Zealand to France and Belgium.An anti-vaccine protest turned ugly Thursday in Wellington, with police clashing with demonstrators on the grounds of parliament and more than 120 people arrested.In France, thousands inspired by the Canadian truckers planned to converge Friday evening on Paris, with some aiming to move onwards to Brussels.Paris police sought to prevent the demonstration, saying they would ban so-called “Freedom Convoys” and would stop roads from being blocked, threatening hefty fines or jail — while Belgian authorities vowed similar action.And in the United States, supporters took to social media announcing a “People’s Convoy” of truckers and “all freedom-loving Americans” to gather east of Los Angeles for a two-day rally beginning March 4 before hitting the road, possibly towards the capital Washington.Canada’s self-styled “Freedom Convoy” began last month in the country’s west — launched in anger at requirements that truckers either be vaccinated, or test and isolate, when crossing the US-Canada border.For two weeks they have occupied the capital Ottawa with loud protests marked by music, honking and banner waving.They have caused significant economic disruption by shutting down the Ambassador suspension bridge — a trade corridor used daily by more than 40,000 commuters and tourists, and trucks carrying US$323 million worth of goods on average.Even Trudeau’s political rival, Tory party interim leader Candice Bergen who earlier expressed support for the protesters, urged them Thursday to end their siege.“I believe the time has come for you to take down the barricades, stop the disruptive action, and come together,” she said from the House of Commons.With blockades dragging on, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined a chorus of industry voices warning of the economic impact — saying it was “imperative” that Canadian officials rapidly de-escalate the situation.Presumably eager to stop the movement spreading further domestically, several provinces including Alberta, Quebec and Saskatchewan this week announced a gradual lifting or loosening of Covid-19 restrictions.A court has already ordered the truckers to stop the incessant honking that has upset residents in Ottawa and made sleep difficult.But the atmosphere on the streets of the capital remained one of defiance and celebration. Some 400 vehicles remain camped on Parliament Hill below Trudeau’s offices, against a backdrop of barbecues, campfires and music.Dennis Elgie, a curling ice technician who came from Toronto to join the protest, called the movement “fantastic.”“I’ve never seen Canadian pride like this,” he told AFP. “This is history.”"

Paul Manaigre stated that the blockade is illegal under the Highway Traffic Act.Manaigre commented on the situation to a local radio station saying, “Handing out 50 tickets doesn’t solve your problem,” and added, “We’re going to have to open up a dialogue.”“You tow one semi, (for) which the logistics are quite extensive, then another takes its place… you’re only inflaming the situation,” he said.The blockade is just the latest along the Canadian border with the United States in recent weeks as protests grow against Canada’s Wuhan coronavirus restrictions, vaccine passports, mandates and other policies.Supporters of Canada’s anti-mandate, trucker-led Freedom Convoy movement shut down traffic on the Ambassador Bridge on Monday. https://t.co/jpgRpD7RK4— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 9, 2022In the province of Alberta, a blockade resumed in the border town of Coutts despite the Alberta government scrapping the vaccine passport programme earlier this week.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/10/report-biden-administration-urges-justin-trudeau-to-use-federal-powers-against-blockade/,"The Biden administration reportedly urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to use federal powers to quell the truck blockade that has halted the flow of auto parts on the Ambassador Bridge.For the past four days, the Canadian “Freedom Convoy” protests have blocked traffic on the main thoroughfare connecting Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, forcing auto plants in both countries to either shut down or slow production due to the delay in parts deliveries.“The White House said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with their Canadian counterparts and urged them to help resolve the standoff,” reported the Associated Press.“A federal government official said they are not ruling out any options,” AP added. “The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.”The bridge carries 25 percent of all trade between the United States and Canada; effects of the blockades were immediately felt by automakers and mid-west economies. Per the AP:Ford said its Windsor engine plant reopened Thursday after being shut down on Wednesday because of a lack of parts. But the factory and the company’s assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario, near Toronto, were operating at reduced capacity, the automaker said.On the U.S. side, GM sent the first shift home two hours early Thursday at its Flint, Michigan, heavy-duty pickup truck plant due to parts shortages. Stellantis cut short the first shift Friday at its Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, due to parts shortages.Honda will temporarily stop production on one assembly line during the day shift Friday at its plant in Alliston, Ontario. It’s because of border delays. U.S. Plants are scheduled to run normally Friday. Toyota said three of its plants in Ontario closed for the rest of the week because of parts shortages, and production also had to be curtailed in Georgetown, Kentucky.Both Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Teamsters union have denounced the blockades.“It’s hitting paychecks and production lines. That is unacceptable,” said Whitmer.Exactly the type of federal powers that Justin Trudeau could employ to stop the blockade was not detailed, though the prime minister has said the military remains off the table for the time being. Local tow truck companies have refused to cooperate with authorities.A person holds a sign reading “Freedom” as truckers and supporters continue to protest against mandates and restrictions related to Covid-19 vaccines in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Dave Chan / AFP) (Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images)Matt Mouroun, chairman of the Detroit International Bridge Company, the owner of the Ambassador Bridge, said the blockade “cannot continue any longer” and outlined three ways for the government to end the protest, according to The Independent:1. End the protest by repealing the mandate and recognising that while the vast majority of truck drivers are vaccinated there are some who for many reasons are choosing not to get vaccinated but deserve to be respected and allowed to do their jobs and serve our countries with dignity.2. Remove the vehicles blocking the Ambassador Bridge so commerce and trade can resume.3. Do nothing and hope this ends on its own: an option that will mostly prolong the blockade, further crippling our economy and putting more jobs at risk.Mouroun hoped that once the conflict came to an end, the United States and Canada can work out an agreement so that the trade thoroughfare does not fall subject to politics again.Trudeau has remained firm in his commitment to continuing the vaccine mandates and coronavirus protocols as several provincial premiers have decided to scale back restrictions.“Canadians have the right to protest, to disagree with their government, and to make their voices heard. We’ll always protect that right,” Trudeau tweeted on Tuesday. “But let’s be clear: They don’t have the right to blockade our economy, or our democracy, or our fellow citizens’ daily lives.

The first came on February 3, when the leftist-run platform GoFundMe froze $10 million in funds destined for the Freedom Convoy.After initially trying to redirect the funds to “verified charities,” GoFundMe backed down in the face of public outcry and threats of investigation from Republican state attorneys general in the U.S, saying it would refund donors instead.In the meantime, the Christian, pro-freedom website GiveSendGo offered to host the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser. In just a week, the new fundraiser has raised over $8.6 million.According to the fundraising page, which was set up by organizers of the Freedom Convoy, funds will be dispersed to truckers participating in the protest to aid in the cost of their journey, to cover the cost of fuel, and for food and shelter as needed.(Photo by Dave Chan/AFP via Getty Images)(Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)While the Ontario court order may make it difficult for the funds to reach the truckers via the traditional finance sector, no court order and no government has the ability to intercept or freeze funds if they are distributed through a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency innovations have even created the potential for transactions that cannot be traced by state actors. “Privacy coins” like Monero, ZCash and Pirate Chain are either anonymous by default, or have options for anonymous and untraceable transactions.Truckers protesting for freedom from draconian coronavirus policies are now blockading border crossings at the Canada-Montana border, the Canada-North Dakota border, and the Ambassador Bridge bordering Canada and Michigan, a critical route for trade between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.The Canadian government has proven powerless in the face of the revolt by essential workers, and cracks are beginning to show in the regime’s unity.The province of Alberta ended its state-mandated vaccine passports earlier this week, although Alberta premier Jason Kenney said businesses would still be allowed to mandate vaccines — a response that did not satisfy the truckers.Footage obtained by Rebel News indicates that Ontario under Doug Ford will also soon release a statement on ending vaccine passports in the province, even as his government seeks to prevent GiveSendGo’s funds from reaching the truckers.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is enduring daily heckles in the Canadian Parliament, and his own liberal party is starting to break ranks.

She warned conservative media that encouraging the protests was “downright dangerous.”“Obviously, we cannot incite and encourage people to break the law, especially when it means they are throwing other Americans out of work and creating an economic crisis that we were just recovering from,” Whitmer emphasized.“[I] t’s dangerous,” she added. “They’re inciting and encouraging people to break the law. And to do so in a way that devastates so many hard-working people — this is families, this is businesses in America that rely on this commerce free-flowing. This is five days, and it has already taken a toll of tens of millions of dollars. That number compounds over time. And any encouragement for people to replicate this and break the law and devastate our economy is not just devastating to our national bottom line but to individual households, to businesses, to agriculture.

https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2022/02/11/ontario-imposes-state-of-emergency-hours-after-report-it-considered-dropping-mandates/,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that he would impose a “state of emergency” in response to the two-week-old “Freedom Convoy” protests that would, he hoped, end blockades in major cities and on international border crossings.Ford also reportedly told journalists that he would soon entirely do away with the vaccine mandate system, a core demand of the protesters, and “all restrictions on businesses.”Ford’s announcement followed a report by Canada’s Rebel News on Thursday claiming that Ford was preparing to abandon the province’s vaccine mandate, which had initially prompted the trucker-led protest. In addition to the large, flagship protest in Ottawa, truckers had moved to blockade Ambassador Bridge, the largest crossing between Canada and America, this week.Ford announced that truckers who did not comply and open the bridge would face prison time and fines of up to $100,000, according to the Canadian Press.Canada’s Rebel News, which has extensively and sympathetically covered the Freedom Convoy trucker protests, on Thursday claimed that it obtained a recording of a phone call from Ontario Premier Doug Ford to his supporters informing them he would abandon the province’s vaccine passport.🚨TRUCKER TRIUMPH: Embattled Ontario Premier deluged by phone calls, caves in to demands to drop vaccine passports.

Monday I’ll be giving some dates. And we’re going to move forward,” Ford said in the call, assuming it is authentic.Most Canadian media coverage of Ontario on Wednesday indicated the vaccine mandate would not be lifted any time soon.

We believe that masking is going to be important for some time to come,” Elliott stated.“We still need to be very careful,” she said. “We are not telling the people of Ontario that this is going to remain in place forever. No. But we are not in the clear, just yet, and so we need to continue to protect Ontarians, protect each other with the passports and with the masks at this point.”The Toronto Sun reported on Wednesday that Ford’s administration was stubbornly “digging in their heels” and refusing to follow advice from local medical experts that it was time to begin easing up:Dr. Matt Strauss, medical officer for Ontario’s Haldimand-Norfolk region, took to social media on Tuesday to announce that “it’s time to end vaccine mandates.”On the same day, Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician who treats COVID patients in the GTA, appeared on CBC to say it’s time Ontario followed the lead of other provinces and places around the world. This perspective adds more adherents by the day,So what’s the hold-up? You’ve got to wonder what Ford and his advisors are thinking right now.The Globe and Mail on Thursday quoted Ontario Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kieran Moore taking a more conciliatory tone and saying “a review of all timelines is absolutely appropriate in the face of the improving data in Ontario, in removal of all public-health measures.”“We want to be transparent to businesses, transparent to Ontarians, on what can be expected in terms of the timelines,” Moore said.Moore said no final decisions about revised timelines had been made yet, but he expected the review process to begin next week. He warned Ontario would take a more “cautious” approach than other provinces that have begun lifting restrictions.AP reports: “On Friday, amid signs that authorities might be prepared to get tough, police in Windsor and Ottawa awaited reinforcements from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the federal police force. Ottawa’s mayor has asked for 1,800 additional police officers, nearly doubling the manpower available to the the city’s police force, which has 2,100 officers and civilian members.”"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/11/canadas-conservative-establishment-turns-on-truckers-take-down-the-barricades/,"Conservative Party interim leader Candice Bergen demanded an end to trucker-led “Freedom Convoy” protests blockading international borders on Thursday, urging anti-mandate demonstrations to end.Her statement in the House of Commons appeared to be a dramatic shift from her initial support for the protests, which have lasted nearly two weeks in the national capital, Ottawa, but have begun to dispute Canada-U.S. supply chains through blockades along Canada’s southern border. Ambassador Bridge, the largest American-Canadian crossing, has come to an ongoing standstill this week as hundreds of trucks park themselves on and around it, inhibiting international traffic.Prior to Bergen’s remarks on Thursday, she had directed most of her ire towards leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has branded those distrusting of Chinese coronavirus mandate products “racist” and “misogynist” and compared the protesters to Nazis.The “Freedom Convoy” protesters are urging an end to all civil rights violations tied to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, including vaccine and mask mandates, business shutdowns, travel restrictions, and mandatory quarantines. This large-scale demand began with truckers, the vast majority of whom are vaccinated, opposing a vaccination mandate for international travel, arguing that most truckers spend much of their work time alone and do not present any significant risk of coronavirus transmission.Protestors and supporters attend a blockade at the foot of the Ambassador Bridge, sealing off the flow of commercial traffic over the bridge into Canada from Detroit, on February 10, 2022 in Windsor, Canada. (Cole Burston/Getty Images)“To all of you who are taking part in the protests, I believe the time has come for you to take down the barricades, stop the disruptive action and come together,” Bergen said on Thursday. “The economy that you want to see reopen is hurting. Farmers, manufacturers, small businesses and families are suffering. I believe this is not what you want to do.”Bergen promised that, if the protests concluded, the Conservative Party “will not stop until the mandates have ended.”Canada’s Globe and Mail noted that Bergen had previously been supportive of the movement, even meeting with protesters in Ottawa and describing them as “peaceful” – an accurate statement according to Ottawa police reports. The protests have enjoyed a festival atmosphere and featured widespread dancing, free food, and bouncy castles and other activities for children.Bergen was one of the Conservative Party’s most enthusiastic supporters of the protests initially.“Conservatives have been opposed to federally mandated vaccines since Trudeau introduced them; and we oppose the mandatory vaccine on Canadian truckers,” Bergen said in a statement in January. “I support peaceful demonstrations against these mandates, and our truckers from Portage-Lisgar and from across Canada.”Protestors and supporters at a blockade at the foot of the Ambassador Bridge, sealing off the flow of commercial traffic over the bridge into Canada from Detroit, on February 10, 2022 in Windsor, Canada. (Cole Burston/Getty Images)Bergen’s initial support came before the Conservative Party ousted former leader Erin O’Toole in early February, resulting in Bergen becoming interim leader. Bergen has not announced if she will run to keep the position. During her first statements in Parliament after becoming interim leader, however, Bergen confronted Trudeau for his consistent insults against the protesters, referring to them as “patriotic, peace-loving Canadians who are called misogynists and racists by the Prime Minister.” During her first remarks as leader, Bergen compared these people to Trudeau, who “wore blackface on more times than he can remember.”Bergen’s stance contrasts significantly with the only person to announce a formal campaign to run the Conservative Party,  Pierre Poilievre, who is currently running uncontested. Poilievre has used his profile to condemn Trudeau, like Bergen, but has not issued any statement urging the protests to end. On the contrary, in an interview with the National Post published on Friday, he blamed any supply chain issues or blockages on Trudeau, not the protesters.Trudeau Under Fire: Why Did You ""Jeopardize"" Our Health to ""Save"" Your Job? pic.twitter.com/5Z11MGhk5e— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2022“I’m proud of the truckers and I stand with them,” Poilievre said in an interview the National Post said it would publish as a podcast interview next week. “They have reached a breaking point after two years of massive government overreach of a prime minister who insults and degrades anyone who disagrees with his heavy-handed approach.”“If Canadians are being inconvenienced, or in any way suffering from these protests, it is because Justin Trudeau made these protests happen and his intransigence is keeping the protests going,” he asserted.Poilievre published a letter to Trudeau on Thursday urging him to “end all federal vaccine mandates, encourage an end to provincial mandates, [and] state clearly that there will be no taxes on the unvaccinated,” asking Canadians to sign it.My open letter calling for the Prime Minister to give Canadians back control of their lives.If you agree, sign here: https://t.co/MLcj8DuAZ0 pic.twitter.com/sVRK6hAksD— pierrepoilievre (@PierrePoilievre) February 10, 2022The letter accused Trudeau of having “spite” for the truckers and asserted that that no evidence suggests that mandating that truckers receive doses of Chinese coronavirus vaccine products would improve the pandemic situation in any way.“You have divided the country. You have told Canadians to fear their neighbors. You have called decent people horrible names. You have destroyed people’s livelihoods on the basis of their personal health choices,” the letter read. “These actions are directly to blame for the protests in Ottawa and across Canada.”“Do not allow your spite towards the trucker protest to stand in the way of doing the right thing.

The NDP is significantly to the left of the Liberal Party, though both Singh and Trudeau have revealed sympathy for communism through affectionate homages to murderous Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty Images)The prime minister is facing aggressive condemnation from the right for his dismissal of the “Freedom Convoy” protests, which call for an end to all coronavirus-related civil rights violations by Trudeau’s government, as a “fringe” full of “tinfoil hats” and Nazis. Leftist leaders and commentators have also accused Trudeau of being too dismissive of the protests but have argued that the largely peaceful protests are violent insurrections that Trudeau has not done enough to crush. Singh has claimed, without evidence, that a conspiracy involving former President Donald Trump, Fox News, the “alt-right,” and a variety of nefarious American actors are the true leaders behind the “Freedom Convoy,” pressuring Trudeau to urge Biden to stop the protests.OTTAWA, ON – FEBRUARY 05: A “Where’s Trudeau?” sign is seen near Parliament Hill on February 5, 2022, in Ottawa, Canada.

It initially began as an opposition movement to Trudeau’s order that all truckers needed to be vaccinated to cross into the United States. The largest iteration of the protests is in Ottawa, the nation’s capital, where thousands of people have crowded into the downtown core for peaceful assemblies calling for an end to mandates. Growing concern has also arisen in the largest crossing between Canada and America – Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, Michigan. That crossing has been blocked for much of this week.Joining the long list of impatient actors waiting for Trudeau to do something on Thursday was, reportedly, President Joe Biden. According to the Associated Press, the White House sent Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to pressure Trudeau to act to unblock Ambassador Bridge; it is unclear at press time if Trudeau responded with any actual plan.Freedom Convoy protesters block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing with the U.S., in Windsor, Ontario, on February 9, 2022 (Photo by Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images).“It is completely inexcusable,” Singh said in a video published to social media on Thursday, referring to Trudeau’s performance generally in response to the convoy. “I have no idea how the prime minister of this country can sit back and let this happen. The prime minister of a G7 nation can’t solve this?”“The prime minister of one of the wealthiest countries in the world can’t make sure people are safe in the nation’s capital? Can’t make sure people don’t feel abandoned? Can’t make sure that our borders are open?” Singh asked. “And there are disputes by the prime minister and the Liberal government federally about who is responsible for the border. Pretty sure the border of a country falls squarely in the responsibility of the federal government.”“And, either way, in a crisis, people don’t want to hear the excuse of jurisdiction,” he continued. “People are fed up and we need to immediately seek leadership to fix this, to solve this, to protect people.”Singh concluded falsely accusing the protesters of “harassing and intimidating people.”I've been asked how I think PM Trudeau has handled the occupations of our borders and the nation's capital.This is my answer. pic.twitter.com/QgxYLVWYIc— Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) February 10, 2022Singh published the video before Trudeau called an emergency meeting of major party leaders to discuss the convoy protests. The meeting first appeared to indicate that Trudeau would announce a plan to address the issue, but reports indicate that he offered no solution or action on the part of his government, instead berating leaders such as Singh and interim Conservative Party leader Candice Bergen to solve the problem.Singh issued another irritated statement after the meeting.“Canadians have been missing national leadership during this crisis,” the NDP leader said, according to Global News. “They’re tired of jurisdictional excuses, they just want this to stop.”Bergen was more conciliatory, thanking Trudeau for the meeting, which she had been requesting for much of the week without an answer.Trudeau held the meeting privately after not appearing in Parliament on Thursday. He made his return to the lawmaking body on Monday after disappearing to an undisclosed location for about a week after announcing that he had tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus. His appearances at parliamentary sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday were, at best, contentious, as lawmakers drowned out much of his rhetoric with jeers and mockery.

The first came on February 3, when the leftist-run platform GoFundMe froze $10 million in funds destined for the Freedom Convoy.After initially trying to redirect the funds to “verified charities,” GoFundMe backed down in the face of public outcry and threats of investigation from Republican state attorneys general in the U.S, saying it would refund donors instead.In the meantime, the Christian, pro-freedom website GiveSendGo offered to host the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser. In just a week, the new fundraiser has raised over $8.6 million.According to the fundraising page, which was set up by organizers of the Freedom Convoy, funds will be dispersed to truckers participating in the protest to aid in the cost of their journey, to cover the cost of fuel, and for food and shelter as needed.(Photo by Dave Chan/AFP via Getty Images)(Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images)While the Ontario court order may make it difficult for the funds to reach the truckers via the traditional finance sector, no court order and no government has the ability to intercept or freeze funds if they are distributed through a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency innovations have even created the potential for transactions that cannot be traced by state actors. “Privacy coins” like Monero, ZCash and Pirate Chain are either anonymous by default, or have options for anonymous and untraceable transactions.Truckers protesting for freedom from draconian coronavirus policies are now blockading border crossings at the Canada-Montana border, the Canada-North Dakota border, and the Ambassador Bridge bordering Canada and Michigan, a critical route for trade between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.The Canadian government has proven powerless in the face of the revolt by essential workers, and cracks are beginning to show in the regime’s unity.The province of Alberta ended its state-mandated vaccine passports earlier this week, although Alberta premier Jason Kenney said businesses would still be allowed to mandate vaccines — a response that did not satisfy the truckers.Footage obtained by Rebel News indicates that Ontario under Doug Ford will also soon release a statement on ending vaccine passports in the province, even as his government seeks to prevent GiveSendGo’s funds from reaching the truckers.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is enduring daily heckles in the Canadian Parliament, and his own liberal party is starting to break ranks.

In addition to the large, flagship protest in Ottawa, truckers had moved to blockade Ambassador Bridge, the largest crossing between Canada and America, this week.Ford announced that truckers who did not comply and open the bridge would face prison time and fines of up to $100,000, according to the Canadian Press.Canada’s Rebel News, which has extensively and sympathetically covered the Freedom Convoy trucker protests, on Thursday claimed that it obtained a recording of a phone call from Ontario Premier Doug Ford to his supporters informing them he would abandon the province’s vaccine passport.🚨TRUCKER TRIUMPH: Embattled Ontario Premier deluged by phone calls, caves in to demands to drop vaccine passports.

No. But we are not in the clear, just yet, and so we need to continue to protect Ontarians, protect each other with the passports and with the masks at this point.”The Toronto Sun reported on Wednesday that Ford’s administration was stubbornly “digging in their heels” and refusing to follow advice from local medical experts that it was time to begin easing up:Dr. Matt Strauss, medical officer for Ontario’s Haldimand-Norfolk region, took to social media on Tuesday to announce that “it’s time to end vaccine mandates.”On the same day, Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician who treats COVID patients in the GTA, appeared on CBC to say it’s time Ontario followed the lead of other provinces and places around the world. This perspective adds more adherents by the day,So what’s the hold-up? You’ve got to wonder what Ford and his advisors are thinking right now.The Globe and Mail on Thursday quoted Ontario Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kieran Moore taking a more conciliatory tone and saying “a review of all timelines is absolutely appropriate in the face of the improving data in Ontario, in removal of all public-health measures.”“We want to be transparent to businesses, transparent to Ontarians, on what can be expected in terms of the timelines,” Moore said.Moore said no final decisions about revised timelines had been made yet, but he expected the review process to begin next week. He warned Ontario would take a more “cautious” approach than other provinces that have begun lifting restrictions.AP reports: “On Friday, amid signs that authorities might be prepared to get tough, police in Windsor and Ottawa awaited reinforcements from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the federal police force. Ottawa’s mayor has asked for 1,800 additional police officers, nearly doubling the manpower available to the the city’s police force, which has 2,100 officers and civilian members.”"

He made a distinction between the truckers and those who are fatigued with his onerous public health mandates, even though the protests started due to Trudeau’s mandates.The Freedom Convoy is a group of truckers who peacefully protest the coronavirus vaccine mandates and other public health regulations implemented by Trudeau. For example, truckers must show proof of vaccination if they want to travel across the Canadian border as of January 15. After traveling to Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, in protest, the truckers made their way to the Ambassador Bridge between Ontario and Detroit on Monday.“I want to make something very clear,” Trudeau told reporters on Friday. “The illegal blockades seeking to take our neighborhoods and our economy hostage and the collective COVID fatigue we are facing are two very separate things.”He’s breaking  pic.twitter.com/91VKbePlNX— Cernovich (@Cernovich) February 11, 2022Trudeau then warned the truckers that they could lose their license or ability to travel to the United States because they participated in the protests.“If you joined the protests because you’re tired of COVID you now need to understand you are breaking laws.

Do it for yourself, do it for your neighbors, most of all, do it for the doctors and nurses who have been completely exhausted after two years of this, so you won’t be putting additional pressure on them. And so I find all of this, all being done in the name of freedom — freedom from who? From Mother Nature? It’s just nonsense. And we’re so late into this.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/11/canadian-freedom-convoy-organizer-vows-ongoing-protests/,"Canadian truckers plan to continue protesting coronavirus restrictions leveled by their government, despite attempts by public officials to disrupt them.“Our biggest tool for change is patience. We got all the time in the world,” B.J. Dichter, the spokesman and vice president of the Canadian “Freedom Convoy” protests told Breitbart News Daily host and Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow in an interview on Sirius-XM Patriot.He reminded Canadian government officials that truckers were used to sitting and waiting as part of their jobs, and they would not blink.Truckers, Dichter said, were seeking two things from their government: an end to the mandated vaccines and an end to the coronavirus passport required for truckers reentering Canada. He expressed surprise and disgust that government leaders refused even to talk to the protesters or discuss their demands.“That’s not how our system works,” he said, referring to democracy in Canada. “They serve the people. Not the other way around. I think they’re going to learn this harsh lesson and that’s going to take a little while.”Despite their polite reputation, Dichter said Canadians ultimately lost their patience with their government leveling more and more restrictions and refusing to walk them back.“Canadians, you can push and push and push and push, but eventually the hockey fighter comes out,” he said.Dichter said the protests are wildly successful, revealing that Canadians across the country are acting independently to push back against their government.“Most of society has been locked in their homes and had their freedoms stripped from them for two years; that’s why it was so easy to motivate people to get out and do something,” he said.He noted that people of both the right and left political ideologies had joined the cause.“We may have differences in life philosophy, but at the end of the day, we all want freedom, and that’s being taken away by the political class itself, and it’s not acceptable,” he said."
https://www.breitbart.com/news/canadian-authorities-look-to-the-courts-to-break-blockade/,"WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered protesters at the Ambassador Bridge over the U.S.-Canadian border to end the 5-day-old blockade that has disrupted the flow of goods between the two countries and forced the auto industry on both sides to roll back production.It was not immediately clear when or if law enforcement officers would be sent in to remove the demonstrators, who parked their pickups and other vehicles in a bumper-to-bumper protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions and an outpouring of fury toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government.Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz of the Ontario Superior Court said during a virtual hearing that the order would be effective at 7 p.m. to give protesters time to leave.Windsor police immediately warned that anyone blocking the streets could be subject to arrest and their vehicles may be seized.At the bridge, a person, who would not provide his name, grabbed a microphone and addressed the crowd. He asked the protesters if they wanted to stay when 7 p.m. rolled around or leave. By a show of applause, it was agreed they would stay. “OK,”’ the man said. “Let’s stand tall.”The crowd responded by singing the Canadian national anthem and chanting “freedom.”Since Monday, drivers mostly in pickup trucks have bottled up the bridge connecting Windsor to Detroit. Hundreds more truckers have paralyzed downtown Ottawa over the past two weeks. And protesters have also blocked two other border crossings, in Alberta and Manitoba.The judge’s decision came after a 4 1/2-hour court hearing at which the city of Windsor and lawyers for auto parts makers argued that the blockade was causing undue economic harm for the city and region.Supporters of the protesters, some of them truckers, argued that an order to disband would disrupt their right to peacefully protest vaccine mandates that hinder their ability to earn a living.The ruling came in a day of fast-moving developments as federal, provincial and local officials worked simultaneously on different fronts to try to break the standoff with the so-called Freedom Convoy, whose members have been cheered on by the right in the U.S., including Fox News personalities, Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.“This unlawful activity has to end and it will end,” Trudeau warned just hours earlier.“We heard you. It’s time to go home now,” the prime minister said, cautioning that “everything is on the table” for ending the blockades.Also Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency and threatened heavy penalties against those who interfere with the free flow of goods and people.Ford said he will convene the provincial cabinet on Saturday to urgently enact measures that make it “crystal clear” it is illegal to block critical infrastructure. Violators will face up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000, he said.“There will be consequences for these actions, and they will be severe,” Ford said. “This is a pivotal, pivotal moment for our nation.”The measures will also provide additional authority “to consider taking away the personal and commercial licenses of anyone who doesn’t comply,” according to the premier’s office.Trudeau called Ontario’s decision “responsible and necessary” and said he spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden about it.“We discussed the American and indeed global influences on the protest,” Trudeau said. “We talked about the U.S.-based flooding of the 911 phone lines in Ottawa, the presence of U.S. citizens in the blockade and the impact of foreign money to fund this illegal activity.”Trudeau said that on some fundraising platforms, as much as 50% of the donations are coming from the U.S.He said he and Biden agreed that “for the security of people and the economy, these blockades can’t continue.”Trudeau said he understands the protesters are frustrated by the pandemic, but “these blockades are hurting everyday families, auto assembly workers, farmers, truckers, blue-collar Canadians.”The protests have caused shortages of auto parts that have forced General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda to close plants or cancel shifts.Before the judge’s ruling came down, dozens of protesters in Windsor blocked the entrance to the bridge in what felt like a block party. Demonstrators milled about, carrying signs and Canadian flags — some at the ends of hockey sticks — while music played and food handed out. A trampoline was set up for the children.Troy Holman, a 32-year-old Windsor resident who has protested every day this week, said he believes the government overreached with its COVID-19 restrictions, which he said hurt his wife’s small business.“Unfortunately, we have to be here, because this is what’s going to get the attention of the government,” he said.Signs read, “Freedom Is Essential,” “Say No to Mandatory Vaccines” and “End Mandates.”“We stand for freedom. We believe that it should be everyone’s personal decision what they inject into their bodies,” said protester Karen Driedger, 40, of Leamington. “We’re saying, ‘That’s enough.’ We need to go back to normal and live our lives again.”Authorities at various levels of government have hesitated to forcibly remove the protesters around the country, reflecting apparently a lack of manpower by local police, Canada’s reverence for free speech, and fears of violence. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens warned earlier this week that some of the truckers are “willing to die.”But the political pressure to reopen the bridge appeared to be mounting along with the economic toll.The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. The standoff comes at a time when the auto industry is already struggling to maintain production in the face of pandemic-induced shortages of computer chips and other supply-chain disruptions.“American legislators are freaking out, and rightfully so,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “Pressure is now being exerted by the White House on Trudeau to act more decisively.”Amid signs that authorities might be prepared to get tough, police in Windsor and Ottawa awaited reinforcements from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the federal police force.Ottawa’s mayor has asked for 1,800 additional police officers, which could nearly double the manpower available to the capital city’s police force.The protests have spread outside Canada as well. Demonstrators angry over pandemic restrictions drove toward Paris in scattered convoys of camper vans, cars and trucks Friday in an effort to blockade the French capital, despite a police ban.And in a bulletin to local and state law enforcement officers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that truck protests may be in the works in the United States. The agency said the protests could begin in Southern California as early as this weekend and spread to Washington around the State of the Union address in March.While the Canadian protesters are decrying vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 restrictions, many of the country’s infection measures, such as mask rules and vaccine passports for getting into restaurants and theaters, are already falling away as the omicron surge levels off.Pandemic restrictions have been far stricter in Canada than in the U.S., but Canadians have largely supported them. The vast majority of Canadians are vaccinated, and the COVID-19 death rate is one-third that of the United States.___Gillies reported from Toronto, Krisher from Detroit. "

Overall, Whitmer’s lead is less than one percent, bringing the race to a statistical tie, with 44.3 percent of likely voters supporting her, compared to 43.7 percent for Craig.The Blueprint Polling survey polled 632 Michigan voters from February 1-4.The difference between Craig and Whitmer is evidenced by their response to the Canadian Freedom Convoy protesting onerous vaccine mandates and public health regulations.Whitmer said the protesters are engaging in an “illegal blockade” and that they “do not have a right to illegally block these international borders where we have so much commerce.” Michigan’s governor even called on the Canadian government to “do whatever it takes” to end the protests.On the other hand, Craig stood in solidarity with the protesters. “I stand with the truckers. I support all working people who are standing up for personal freedom,” Craig said. “What we are seeing is a tremendous lack of leadership from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Joe Biden and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.”He added:I reject big government socialism, and I reject the notion that working people standing up for freedom are somehow the problem. We need real leadership. President Biden, who often touts his blue-collar bonafides, should stand up for working people and call out Prime Minister Trudeau for his arrogance and failure to lead.In addition to a potential gubernatorial match-up, the poll also asked voters about a 2024 presidential rematch between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Biden carried Michigan by less than three percentage points in the 2020 election.After more than one year of Biden’s presidency, Trump is polling ahead of Biden among Michigan voters. Trump’s support is at 40.4 percent compared to Biden’s 38.2 percent. However, 13.4 percent of respondents remain undecided, and eight percent said they would support a third-party candidate.The poll also found that Biden’s grip on the black vote loosened, with more than one-third of black voters undecided or supporting a third-party candidate.The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percent."

It’s a very small group of people, but that doesn’t shy away from the fact that they take up some space,” Trudeau said previously, conintuing: “This leads us, as a leader and as a country, to make a choice: Do we tolerate these people?”“But now it’s blown up in his face,” Poilievre said. “So he’s gotten himself into an impossible political situation. And unfortunately, the rest of the country is held hostage by his unwillingness to do the right thing, admit he was wrong, and lift these mandates.”Canadian Elites are doing everything they can to trash the Freedom Convoy movement with smears and attacks. https://t.co/qaOn5Ey0EA— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2022Poilievre announced his intention to run for the leadership of the CPC following the ousting of former leader Erin O’Toole in a shock vote by CPC MPs during the first week of the Freedom Convoy protests.CPC Interim leader Candice Bergen has also expressed her support for the Freedom Convoy protestors and slammed Prime Minister Trudeau earlier this week in the Hous of Commons, saying: “I look at our country Mr Speaker, and I’ve never seen it as divided as it is now under this prime minister.”“Does he regret calling people names who didn’t take the vaccine?” Bergen asked.“Does he regret calling people misogynist and racist and just, escalating and poking sticks at them and being so divisive to individual Canadians that he might not disagree with, that he might have thought were wrong?”Freedom Convoy: Truckers Form New Border Blockade in Manitoba https://t.co/kQhzSuFa0l— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2022Just days later on Thursday, Bergen stated that while she agreed with the sentiment of the protestors, she called on them to abandon the protests across the country and return home.“The time has come for you to take down the barricades, stop the disruptive action and come together,” she said, adding: “The economy you want to see reopened is hurting. You protested because you love your country and you want your freedoms back. That message has been heard.”"

Police have created checkpoints, deployed armored personnel carriers and set up water cannons to brace the city for the protests. So far, the police blockade action has seemed effective.Railing against the vaccination pass that France requires to enter restaurants and many other venues, protesters have tried to weave toward Paris from north, south, east and west, waving and honking at onlookers from their car windows. Some convoys sought to avoid police detection Friday by traveling local roads instead of the major highways leading into the capital.PARIS – Le périphérique est à l’arrêt, la police contrôle un #ConvoiDesLibertes qui tente de rejoindre la capitale. #ConvoiFrance2022 pic.twitter.com/5Hz6eJleO5— Clément Lanot (@ClementLanot) February 12, 2022Waving French flags and shouting “freedom,” the protesters organized online, galvanized in part by truckers who have blockaded Canada’s capital and blocked border crossings. The French action has no single leader or goal, and comes as months of protests against French government vaccination rules have been waning.It’s not just in France that such protests are brewing. Dozens of trucks and other vehicles, from tractors to a car towing a caravan arrived in The Hague Saturday morning as part of a “freedom convoy,” blocking an entrance to the historic parliamentary complex.A group of protesters joined the truckers carrying a banner emblazoned with the Dutch words “Love & freedom, no dictatorship.”Police urged the protesters to move to a park, where the municipality said they could demonstrate, and warned the public about traffic problems in the city.French Police Ready Armoured Cars, Heavy Moving Equipment Ahead of Anti-Lockdown ‘Freedom Convoy’ Protesthttps://t.co/UuNFgsDtV9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2022"

It is part of New Zealand” — authorities quickly shifted their stance and declared that the protestors are in fact trespassing.Convoy participants have challenged this order, questioning how they can trespass on public property, saying it belongs to the people as it had been paid for by the “blood of our forefathers on the battlefield” and “our taxes”.Protestors, including those using their vehicles to block the roads around the Parliament, have committed to staying in place “as long as it takes” for the government to repeal coronavirus restrictions such as obligatory masks for children in schools and vaccine mandates for certain jobs such as healthcare workers.New Zealand Police Back off as Freedom Convoy Protests Buildhttps://t.co/naaCPOJt3I— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2022"

This is an illegal action, it is economic terrorism,” Blackburn News reports.“Politicians aren’t supposed to direct police, but in an ideal world what I would be saying is this, ticket, tow and arrest if necessary because this is illegal,” Bradley added.Protestors began the blockade of Highway 402 on Wednesday morning according to a report from broadcaster CBC and blocked part of the highway with 15 tractors, many of which were beating Canadian flags.Freedom Convoy: Truckers Form New Border Blockade in Manitoba https://t.co/kQhzSuFa0l— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2022“We’re going to stand,” a protestor named Simon told the broadcaster and added, “Ottawa is going to stand.

Martin Luther King Jr. won the battle for civil rights, it’s because he was right, and by right, I mean morally right.The essence of King’s argument was, All we want is to be treated like everyone else and to be judged by our character, not our skin color.Not to take anything away from King’s genius and courage, but had he not been morally right, his cause would have failed. But he succeeded because even the most ignorant bigot understands that judging someone by something as meaningless as skin color is not only blatantly immoral; it defies reason. There’s no way around that truth.Leaders of the African American Movement pose in New York on July 29, 1964, as they hold conference on civil rights (AP Photo/Eddie Adams).What King did was show the world just how far Democrats in the segregated South were willing to go to defend immoral laws that violated basic human rights. He deliberately pushed the issue to where midnight terror campaigns could no longer enforce this injustice.You’re going to throw me in prison for sitting in the front of a bus? You’re not going to arrest the guy who assaulted my sister for sitting at a lunch counter? You’re going to unleash firehoses, dogs, and billy clubs on women and children?The psychology behind this was brilliant: How far are you willing to go to enforce an unjust law? Oh, and Mr. and Mrs. America, I’m going to make you watch and dare you to continue to remain immorally silent.   Gandhi understood this when he famously said, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 1869 – 1948), Indian nationalist and spiritual leader, leading the Salt March in protest against the government monopoly on salt production (Central Press/Getty Images).King studied Gandhi.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not.How far is Adolph Trudeau willing to go to enforce unjust laws that discriminate and violate human rights? That’s the question this glorious Freedom Convoy is forcing him to answer.By any measure, Trudeau’s vaccine mandates are indefensible. Trudeau’s dehumanizing rhetoric against the unvaccinated (or those who support the vaccine and oppose mandates) is monstrous. Trudeau’s willingness to practice open segregation against people over personal medical choices is tyrannical.What Democrat Gov. George Wallace was to the civil rights movement, Justin Trudeau is to the Freedom Convoy.Clouds of tear gas fill the air as state troopers, ordered by Gov. George Wallace, break up a demonstration march in Selma, Ala., March 7, 1965, on what became known as “Bloody Sunday” (AP Photo/File).Trudeau is the villain fighting an unjust cause.Trudeau is the fascist willing to destroy innocent people’s livelihoods to enforce immoral laws.Trudeau is the gangster ready to commit violence rather than admit he is wrong.If you want to know why Trudeau has been forced into hiding and why he serially melts down into a puddle of fecklessness in public, it’s because he is wrong. It’s that simple. He has no moral ground to stand on, which is why he’s attempted to manufacture it with lies about “racists” and “swastikas.” But in this ongoing civil rights standoff, everyone knows the bottom-line question is this…How far is Trudeau willing to go to enforce a mandate for a vaccine that doesn’t even stop the spread of the coronavirus? How much violence is he willing to commit? How many livelihoods is he willing to annihilate for a vaccine that doesn’t even stop you from catching the virus?Not that the success of the vaccine matters. Even if the vaccine did eradicate the virus, his stance would be just as immoral, but now that we know the vaccine does not stop the transmission, his stand looks especially foolish.Like George Wallace and his fellow Democrat Bull Connor and all the Democrats who created and enforced Jim Crow, Trudeau is a bully checkmated by his own immoral choices.Trudeau is wrong.The truckers are right.Your move, Adolph.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I hear and respect her. But I call for the greatest calm.”At the time of this reporting, five people have been arrested for carrying slingshots and police have used tear gas and used tractors and tow trucks to remove vehicles from the Champs-Elysées area.La tension ne retombe pas sur les #ChampsElysees après plusieurs heures d’incidents. #convoisdelaliberte pic.twitter.com/5uTsMPNjhC— Clément Lanot (@ClementLanot) February 12, 2022Police were also seen using their batons on protesters, in footage shared on social media by street photographer Clément Lanot.PARIS – Interpellation sur les #ChampsElysees : tensions toujours en cours. #ConvoidelaLiberte @CLPRESSFR pic.twitter.com/Moh5QZhyYl— Clément Lanot (@ClementLanot) February 12, 2022The Prefecture of Paris police force said that 7,200 officers were deployed in the city to prevent the convoy from embedding itself.

https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2022/02/12/fncs-carlson-threats-against-freedom-convoy-show-canadian-officials-impotent-because-they-lost/,"Friday, FNC host Tucker Carlson criticized Canadian officials threatening fines and imprisonment against Freedom Convoy truck protesters.The Fox News host said the rhetorical response was a product of those officials’ impotence against the protests.Transcript as follows:CARLSON: So we’ve been covering this truck strike in Canada all week and at the end of the week, there are a couple of different images that kind of float around your head, picture the cops stealing the fuel from the freezing truckers, you picture the smiling truckers talking about love and waving Canadian flags, totally nonthreatening.But above all, you remember the hysteria of the people in charge as they look out on the sea of working class people who are really sick of being pushed around, told what to inject into their bodies.The people in charge are extremely upset about this, hysterical and it is hilarious. You can just picture our Transportation Secretary, little Pete Buttigieg jumping up and down, shaking his little hands, screaming at the truck drivers, “Get off my bridge, you guys. Get off right now.”It’s not just Mayor Pete. You remember those angry tweets of that CNN contributor lady who suggested we should slash their tires, siphon their diesel fuel, throw them in prison. They’re all Torquemada now.They’re talking like they’re scary, but keep in mind, these are not displays of power. This is not how confident people talk. These are squeaks of impotence.Our leaders are furious at the truckers because they know there’s not a lot they can do about the truckers. They don’t know anything about trucks for one thing. How do you get a truck off a bridge, especially when it has no fuel or tires? They have no idea. You just order someone to do it. It’s kind of like Uber Eats. Some guy trots out and removes the truck.The problem is, the people who drive the trucks don’t feel like following orders anymore. They’re ignoring Pete Buttigieg. If you actually want to move a big rig, you need tow truck operators, and those tow truck operators know truckers. They know truckers aren’t racist. They’re not Nazis, no matter how many times Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau claim they are.So some of them aren’t inclined to help. David Allen, for example, is the President of Gary’s Towing in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He told Canadian media quote: “We have all the capabilities on our tow trucks to do it, but I don’t think anyone would want to.”Another tow truck operator called Randy Juan said that even if tow truck operators want to help, carry out Pete Buttigieg’s orders, it will be very hard, quote, “In the end the truckers are going to say whether you’re taking that truck away or not.”Now, there are technical reasons for this, which apparently they don’t teach at McKinsey. It turns out that trucks are heavy. They have air brakes and steel belted tires. So, the truckers remove their tires completely. So what now? Now is when you start to panic, and they definitely are.This afternoon, the Prime Minister of Canada who clearly is Fidel Castro’s illegitimate son, came out from hiding to threaten the protesters directly. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: If you join the protests, because you’re tired of COVID, you now need to understand you are breaking laws. The consequences are becoming more and more severe.You don’t end up losing your license, end up with a criminal record, which will impact your job, your livelihood, even your ability to travel internationally, including to the U.S.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You could be breaking laws, that was the funniest part. These are people who literally don’t care about the law at all. They believe they make the law.This is the Prime Minister who ordered the cops to steal people’s fuel. There’s no law that says you can’t have fuel in Ottawa. He just made that up. Now, he is lecturing them about the law. And Joe Biden who is violating Federal law on the grand scale every day by importing two million people illegally without your consent, he is upset about the law.Justin Trudeau is so upset, he is threatening the truckers’ children, quote: “It’s time to go home, especially if you have your kids with you.” Trudeau said, wouldn’t want something to happen to them.Trudeau also attacked the protesters for closing the border. Only Justin Trudeau is allowed to do that, which he has done for more than a year.So what are we watching here? It’s more than hypocrisy. What we’re watching is panic.Justin Trudeau knows nobody joined the protest because they’re quote, “tired of COVID.” They’re tired of tyranny. They’re tired of being told to inject something into their bodies they don’t want, whose long term effects cannot be known, sold by companies that are protected, that have immunity from public recourse.We also know that what they told us to do didn’t work. The lockdowns didn’t work. Johns Hopkins came out and said it the other day, pretty conclusive. That’s what people are mad about. They want their freedom back. They’re not tired of the virus. They’re tired of the leaders who use the virus to give themselves more power, and they’re still doing it.Here is Ontario’s premier Doug Ford. He announced today that instead of lifting his province’s useless mandates, he’s going to steal the truckers’ money, find them, and then send them to jail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOUG FORD, ONTARIO’S PREMIER: There will be consequences for these actions, and they will be severe. We’ve already started by going after the money funding the illegal occupation yesterday and Ontario Court granted our requests to freeze the funds from GiveSendGo for the convoy.Fines for noncompliance will be severe with a maximum penalty of $100,000.00 and up to a year imprisonment. We will also provide additional authority to consider taking away the personal and commercial licenses of anyone who doesn’t comply with these orders.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: When you start making threats like that, you’ve already lost. What you’re showing is that you’re impotent and that is why you’re unreasonable. That’s why you’re hysterical. That’s why you’re waving your arms around and telling people they are going to prison.When you start stealing things from people, outside the laws, speaking of the law, everybody knows you’re weak.So keep in mind, the truckers raised $10 million on GoFundMe. That’s a California company, but Canadian politicians had that effort shut down, then GiveSendGo, which is a Delaware company raised almost the same amount and Canadian politicians went after that money, too.The Attorney General of Ontario successfully got a Court order to freeze access to the $8.4 million raised on GiveSendGo, those funds are going to an adopted trucker fundraising campaign. It was paying for quote, “… housing, water, food, accommodations and shuttle services for truck drivers in Ottawa.” But all of that money has just been stolen by the Canadian government, it has been seized.All of this is pushing people away from government issued currencies because they’re in control of lunatics like the guy you just saw and they are moving toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Just like 18-wheelers and bridges, blockchain is pretty tough for the authorities to control. Therefore, here is how you know it’s a threat. The crypto guys must be White supremacist, and lo and behold, that’s exactly what they’re now telling us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It’s an avenue, not just to make a lot of money or lose a lot of money, but it’s also an avenue for money laundering and it is also a place where White supremacists, apparently are taking options.I mean, it’s problematic, at best, in so many ways.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It’s problematic at best — how do people like that get on television? There should be an IQ requirement. But by putting dumb people in the anchor chair, they’re perfectly compliant to the people in charge. Crypto is White supremacy. But the hysteria gives them away.As a trucker called Daniel Searsly (ph) explained in Ottawa last night, these people are terrified. They’re afraid of losing control, the blockade at the Windsor Bridge panicked them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SEARSLY, TRUCKER: They blocked the Ambassador Bridge. Yea, that’s the busiest border crossing in between Canada and U.S.A. Most trade goes through that port. So it’s ending up good, you know.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So the downside of all of this is, it is turning Canada into a legitimate police state for real. Here’s one of Doug’s Ford’s police officers harassing a woman at her home because something she wrote on Facebook in support of the truckers. It’s one of the creepiest clips you’re going to see today. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POLICE OFFICER: This is just some information about peaceful protests. That’s all it is.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Okay, so you saw something on my Facebook?POLICE OFFICER: No, on the Facebook group.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, the Ontario Provincial Police are watching what people are doing on Facebook in different groups, whether or not they’re commenting, participating, liking, and you guys are now doing service calls to give people information about peaceful protests.POLICE OFFICER: It’s just a proactive measure to make sure you understand your right to go to a peaceful protests.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It is so great. In 2020, the Stasi are chirpy. We are here as a proactive measure to inform you of your rights, not because we’ve been spying on your social media.So to recap, donating to the truckers is criminals, saying anything positive about the truckers gets the police to show up at your house. That’s why truckers are the new QAnon, Russia, White supremacist extremist threat.Our leaders in this country agree.In Michigan, dopy old Gretchen Whitmer is plotting to attack them with bulldozers. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR Do police need to begin arresting people in the blockade?GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): I am not going to weigh into what — how they proceed. I’m going to tell you right now, though, they have to get it done and using whatever tool it takes to safely and swiftly and this is what we’re calling on them to do.KEILAR: Trucker inspired protests in the U.S. potentially in your state. Would you forcibly clear people?WHITMER: Brianna, if people are breaking the law, obviously we’ll assess it at the time, but we are working very closely with our Federal partners and the State Police. The fact of the matter is we’re going to do everything we can to prevent that from happening in the first place.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Working closely with our Federal partners says the human mask lady. Keep in mind, they’re not talking about ISIS. These are truck drivers. The people who bring you food.They are unarmed. They’re waving Canadian flags and talking about love, a lot of them brought their kids. Should CNN’s National Security contributors and the neoliberal politicians who are attacking them really weigh into this fight? No, because they can’t win it. One side is too sympathetic, and the other is too loathsome.But they can’t help themselves. They are so threatened by disobedience, they rush forward with swords drawn. They know if Canadian truckers can get away with this, the game is over. So they must crush anyone who questions the high priests of neoliberalism and that category includes plenty people on the right, obviously, but tellingly, it includes plenty of people who aren’t on the right, but just feel like thinking for themselves.It includes anyone who invests in Bitcoin, as we said. It includes Sikh truck drivers in Ottawa who now work for Putin and Joe Rogan is now a racist, and David Portnoy, he is now a sex offender and Tavis Smiley is now a serial harasser.Those aren’t right wingers. They’re just people who dare to say what they think. That slander hasn’t worked and it won’t work here. You can’t cancel a bridge full of 18 wheelers and shame them into driving away.They’re going to try it tomorrow. There is going to be a showdown in Windsor, Ontario. We’ll see what happens. But the rest of the world has already learned the lesson, which is if you resist, if you say “I’ve had enough” peacefully, cheerfully, with love, they have to pay attention. The only thing they pay attention to.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/12/exclusive-fmr-detroit-police-chief-james-craig-i-stand-with-those-truckers-for-fighting-for-freedom/,"Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig supports the Freedom Convoy protesters demonstrating on the Ambassador Bridge and finds it “shameful” and “hypocritical” that Michigan Democrat leaders are calling for their removal.Craig, a Republican hoping to unseat one such Democrat, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in this year’s gubernatorial election, doubled down on his pro-protester position during an interview with host Matthew Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday after Whitmer ally Attorney General Dana Nessel attacked him for it.“As you might recall, I was part of the 2020 ‘summer of love’ that so many talk about, and so it infuriated me because this is a great example of big government socialism. We see it here in our own country. We see it in our state,” Craig observed. “So, yes, I stand with those truckers for fighting for freedom,” he said, adding that he also stands with police officers.Listen:Craig initially vocalized his support on Friday for the protesters on the bridge, which connects his city of Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, and serves as a major trade route between the U.S. and Canada.Upon speaking out, Nessel directly attacked Craig, calling his stance “abhorrent” and accusing Republicans of belonging to the “party of lawlessness, insurrection, and anarchy.”Coming from a former law enforcement officer, I find this abhorrent. Laws should be applied and enforced equally to everyone, irrespective of the motivation of those in violation of the law. This is why so many now feel free to disregard statutes which keep our society safe. https://t.co/hpyRrNsCAo— Dana Nessel (@dananessel) February 11, 2022Once again, I ask the Republican candidates for MI Attorney General to state their position on this matter. Time to stop allowing Republicans to label themselves the party of “law and order.” They are, instead, the party of lawlessness, insurrection, and anarchy.— Dana Nessel (@dananessel) February 11, 2022“The state AG, top cop of the state, who didn’t offer Detroit any support during this ‘summer of love,’ now you want to criticize me as it being appalling that I would support people who stand up for freedom? Shameful,” Craig said, also noting that her “hypocrisy” was “clear.”Craig has an extensive background in law enforcement. He worked for the Los Angeles Police Department for about 30 years, then became police chief in Portland, Maine, and later Cincinnati, Ohio, and then stepped into the role of chief of the Detroit Police Department, where he served for eight years until 2021.James Craig, a former Detroit Police Chief, announces he is a Republican candidate for governor of Michigan in Detroit, September 14, 2021. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)Craig, who dealt directly with the protests and violent riots that stemmed from Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020, drew a comparison to today’s Freedom Convoy protest, where participants are expressing opposition to forced coronavirus vaccinations and related mandates.He explained that he successfully managed the protests in Detroit in 2020 because he let peaceful protesters demonstrate but mobilized law enforcement for any nonpeaceful occurrences.“When cities were burning around our country — some cities were burning in our great state of Michigan — Detroit didn’t burn. We didn’t retreat,” Craig explained. “But we allowed, so long as the protesters were peaceful, like these truckers, we allowed them to march. They took over streets. So long as they kept it moving, we allowed them to march. As soon as they started to attack our men and women on the frontline, police officers, we took a firm stand on it. So the hypocrisy— I don’t care what ideology someone supports, once they violate the law, become violent, that’s where it stops.”Craig also noted that he did not believe Black Lives Matter, an organization with radical anti-capitalist origins, had a message that resonated with residents of his majority-black city. Nearly 80 percent of the Detroit population is black, but yet the city did not see the same destruction as certain other cities, like Seattle and Portland, Oregon.“I stood face to face with this group. This group did not represent the black community. It did not,” Craig said. “Because it’s called called Black Lives Matter or Detroit Will Breathe? The underpinnings of Black Lives Matter, as we know, are Marxist, and we also— many of the people that have come to the cities around the country proclaiming that they’re connected to Black Lives Matter, well, not really, because if black lives truly mattered, they stand silent on the majority of what happens in unfortunately, in communities of color is black on black crime, but no one never wants to address that issue.”“It’s not police, killing black men, as much as it is black men killing black men,” Craig asserted. “So this group, didn’t represent Detroit and it couldn’t get traction in Detroit. They were not credible in Detroit.”Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com. Follow her on Twitter at @asholiver."

Additionally, the Prime Minister and ministers discussed further immediate actions the federal government is considering, and will reconvene tomorrow.No details were provided outlining the “escalation of the current occupation” attributed to the Freedom Convoy demonstrators or its supporters. No specific information was provided regarding the “further immediate actions” being considered by the federal government.Trudeau did not specify whether Sunday’s meeting would be in-person or held remotely as per Health Canada’s advisories regarding remote work and government employees as protective measures against COVID-19."

The mandates should have not happened. I’m very proud of Warp Speed. Everybody has given us credit. Nobody thought it was possible to do what we did.

Brussels Police have warned motorists to avoid trying to drive into the city.Authorities in charge of other European cities, such as Paris and Vienna, have made similar attempts to ban demos styled on anti-mandatory vaccine protests in Canada, though all so far have been futile.According to a report by the Brussels Times, demonstrators planning on taking part in the convoy — which was banned by authorities last Thursday — had said that they were set on continuing with their plans, regardless of what local authorities say.“They can’t stop us,” one activist is reported as saying online. “Go on and fight for your freedom.

Furthermore, the government figures the paper claims to have seen shows there was actually a drop-off in the numbers being jabbed since the legal mandate came into force on February 5.According to the Kronen Zeitung report, instead of increasing the uptake of jabs, the number of vaccinations actually declined, starting the day before the new forced vax rules came into force.“There is no mandatory vaccination effect – and if there is, then rather in the other direction,” the publication claimed.In particular, the publication notes significant lows for those getting jabbed on February 6 — one day after the obligation came into force — and February 12, which both reportedly saw major drop-offs in the number of first, second and booster jabs being administered.The source of the figures released by Kronen Zeitung is reportedly the office of City Councilor for Health Peter Hacker, which has since criticised the new vaccination rules.“All in all, the Austrian instruments relating to measures and vaccination do not result in a well-rounded strategy and have no recognizable goal,” the office is reported to have told Kronen Zeitung. “That is why no run on vaccinations is to be expected in the coming days and weeks.”While the released figures do appear to run with the publication’s claim, Breitbart London was not able to independently verify Kronen Zeitung’s claim, as the data is not yet publicly available as of the time of writing.MANDATORY VAX: Austria Enacts COMPULSORY Jabs for All Adults on Saturdayhttps://t.co/lE7O1AbYsi— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2022While mandatory vaccination rules aimed at curbing the Chinese Coronavirus may not have caused a spike in the number of Viennese getting jabbed, it does appear that it has resulted in a spike in the number of unhappy Austrians attending anti-lockdown protests.Since the announcement of the forced vaccination measures last year, thousands of people have attended anti-mandate demos in Vienna and beyond, with many demanding an end to the nation’s various anti-COVID measures.Of particular note was a recent Convoy demonstration that took place in Vienna that bore a striking resemblance to “Freedom Convoy” anti-lockdown protests taking place in Canada and beyond.According to a Kronen Zeitung report, columns of vehicles — some equipped with flags — moved through the city centre, honking their horns as they drove past police.This is despite the demonstration being banned in advance by authorities, with the publication also claiming that a general ban on honking is also in place in Vienna.Despite the government bans, however, the convoy-style demonstration looks set to become a regular feature on Viennese streets, with one reporter claiming that the dates for future demos are already being established online.Nachdem die Polizei sich heute vorführen hat lassen, wird es nun regelmäßig Konvois in Wien geben., Die ersten Termine machen auf Telegram bereits die Runde. #w1102 pic.twitter.com/IlYaX6Gks6— Markus Sulzbacher (@msulzbacher) February 11, 2022"
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/13/freedom-convoy-macron-accused-of-campaigning-with-armoured-vehicles-as-nearly-100-protesters-arrested/,"French President Emmanuel Macron has been slammed for the use of armoured police vehicles against the banned Paris Freedom Convoy after nearly 100 were arrested by police.Paris saw police arrest 97 people on Saturday, as the nation’s Freedom Convoy protest hit the streets of the capital, despite a ban imposed by French authorities.According to a report by Le Monde, 81 people were in police custody as of 6 am this morning local time, with one of those held being described as one of the “faces” of France’s “Yellow Vest” movement.Meanwhile, an internal investigation into the actions of one officer is being launched, after a video emerged online showing one demonstrator being left with a head injury after being struck by police.“A video is currently circulating on social networks following a police intervention on the Champs-Elysées,” the publication reports the authorities as saying. “The prefect is having an internal administrative investigation launched.”Police also emphasised that the ban on the protest remains ongoing, according to the Le Monde report.Hundreds of fines have also been handed out to individuals during the demonstrations, according to POLITICO.One piece of footage which emerged on social media even appears to show police tear gas being used against a café.Les capsules de gaz lacrymogènes atterrissent à l’intérieur d’un café. #ChampsElysees #convoisdelaliberte pic.twitter.com/4oqujumrE7— Remy Buisine (@RemyBuisine) February 12, 2022Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron received swift backlash for the police use of armoured vehicles against the banned demonstration.Like a number of other countries in Europe and further afield, France has begun a harsh crackdown on anti-lockdown protesters, with video emerging yesterday of law enforcement beating demonstrators and breaking the windows of cars.Right-wing populist presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has been one of the big names to hit out at President Macron, who she accused of kicking off his presidential reelection campaign with “armoured vehicles”.“In the wake of the arrival of armoured vehicles from the gendarmerie in Paris, he could declare his candidacy because, symbolically, I find that it resembles his mandate,” Le Pen said, saying Macron’s previous five years in the presidency has been characterised by “chaos, disorder, conflict, division of the French people.”Départ des blindés des #ChampsElysees.Retour au calme progressif après 9H de tensions sur l’avenue. #convoisdelaliberte pic.twitter.com/QbRXvMCT0x— Remy Buisine (@RemyBuisine) February 12, 2022“Energy prices keep rising. No government response. The vaccination pass is useless and yet it does not remove this device that violates individual freedoms,” Le Pen had previously said regarding the demonstrations. “I understand the annoyance of the French.”Socialist presidential candidate Nathalie Arthaud also praised the demonstrations, describing them as “the denunciation of soaring gas prices”, “precariousness” and “low wages”.“They are right to fight and I applaud them for inviting themselves into this election campaign,” the candidate told France Info. “It feels good to finally hear about the problems of the working classes.”Firebrand populist candidate Eric Zemmour also took aim at Emmanuel Macron, saying that he had drastically mismanaged the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic.“The vaccination pass must be abolished,” Zemmour wrote online. “Emmanuel Macron has decidedly mismanaged this epidemic crisis. I have been saying since December that we must take lasting measures because the epidemic is becoming endemic.”Watch: French Police Break Car Windows, Beat Protesters as Freedom Convoy Demo Bursts into Parishttps://t.co/ZrnPoKIk0G— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 12, 2022"

It reminded Canadians who they really are: courageous and free. We watched the joy spread as everyone came together to stand for the freedom to choose. Convoy to Save America carries that same message of unity, togetherness, and peace across the US to help remind all Americans who we really are. We stand together for everyone’s freedom to choose. No mandates, no mask rules, no more lies.In a social media post on Sunday, Picone shared a live video of what appeared to be protesters at the event:https://www.facebook.com/dale.federico/videos/277314187846725/Convoy for USA trucks from TN!!#opentheborderPosted by Marcella Picone on Sunday, February 13, 2022Meanwhile, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said the city was ready for the convoy’s arrival.“We’re ready for these trucks, but our goal is to keep our roadways open and to make sure that residents and visitors are safe and healthy,” Brown commented.The group planned to gather at Pat Sole Park, according to WIVB.The outlet reported Saturday that hundreds of people joined forces near the Peace Bridge to voice opposition to the mandates regarding border travel.“I’m here supporting freedom. We need to have our rights back. We need to have the choice,” stated rally attendee Wendy Dominski."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/14/nolte-moral-chasm-between-black-lives-matter-freedom-convoy/,"Other than watching Adolph Trudeau react to the Freedom Convoy like a mewling little gerbil, my favorite part of the trucker protests has been sizzling hot takes like this:  Wait, Now the Right Loves Traffic-Blocking Protesters?It truly is an astounding act of mental midgetry…Let’s begin with the obvious… The least of the sins committed by the domestic terrorists in Black Lives matter is blocking traffic. For most of 2020, these violent marauders burned, looted, beat, and destroyed — much of the time in predominantly black neighborhoods. These monsters caused a record amount of property damage, and much of that property was owned by working people. Oh, and now tens of millions of dollars in Black Lives Matter donations remain *lol* unaccounted for.The Freedom Convoy burned, looted, and beat … nothing and no one. No violence of any kind, just video after video of a block party atmosphere, of everyday people having a good time — a sight our elites hate even more than themselves.The Freedom Convoy also did its level best to target their protests at the government. Compare that to the terrorists in Black Lives Matter, who mostly rampaged against business districts and targeted innocent retailers, including mom and pop stores, for total destruction.As far as the traffic blocking, let’s look squarely at that…Would you prefer to deal with a vicious and violent mob swarming your car — which is how Black Lives Matter blocked traffic — or a truck just sitting there?I’m not saying the Freedom Convoy isn’t inconveniencing everyday people. Of course it is. The honking, the traffic issues… But it is peaceful. And guess who else blocked bridges and inconvenienced everyday people? Rev. Martin Luther King. There is a long and glorious history of civil disobedience in Western culture. All the Freedom Convoy is guilty of is proudly picking up that baton and running with it.Let me add that the Freedom Convoy’s blocking of a crucial bridge between the U.S. and Canada was every bit as strategic and righteous as the Civil Rights protests on Edmund Pettis Bridge 57 years ago.And let’s not forget who invented this suddenly-insidious idea of traffic blocking, who normalized traffic blocking as a legitimate form of protest. That was Black Lives Matter, along with their cheerleaders in the organized left, the Democrat party, and the corporate media.Hey, once something is normalized and accepted as legitimate, why shouldn’t everyone join in?Let’s also look at what these respective groups are fighting for…What exactly does Black Lives Matter want? What is their list of demands? There are none.King wanted equal treatment under the law.The Freedom Convoy is fighting for the same rights rich celebrities at the Super Bowl and Oscars enjoy.Black Lives Matter literally wants you on your knees.Finally, let’s look at what’s on the line…Besides upgrading their home entertainment systems, what exactly does Black Lives Matter risk? Nothing. They are almost all professional activists, criminals, and students. What’s more, they can commit the most heinous of crimes, get arrested, and immediately be set loose by far-left prosecutors and Kamala Harris’s bail fund.Compare that to these truckers who are working-class guys with bills to pay, families to feed, and who showed up with their own rigs, which were at risk of government confiscation. These guys lost wages, incurred massive expenses, and agreed to participate, knowing the corporate media and their own government would smear them as terrorists and Nazis.And now my closing argument:WATCH: Canadian protesters in Alberta eating bar-b-que ask police why they arrived with guns drawn pic.twitter.com/XFOcdGfjgi— Honkmaster Poso 🎺 (@JackPosobiec) February 14, 2022 Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/14/justin-trudeau-tanks-in-the-polls-with-both-supporters-and-opponents-of-freedom-convoy/,"Far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a popularity collapse, several polls published this weekend found, in the aftermath of his handling of the ongoing “Freedom Convoy” anti-mandate protests – with both supporters and opponents of the protesters.Trudeau has branded the thousands participating in trucker-led protests nationwide “a few people shouting and waving swastikas” and described them as wearing “tinfoil hats.” He has refused to engage in any discussions with those supporting a full repeal of civil rights violations in the name of containing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and rejected calls from members of a variety of political parties in the country to appeal to unity and dialogue to resolve the protests.The “Freedom Convoy” is a national series of peaceful protests characterized by truckers using their large vehicles to block international crossings along Canada’s southern border and occupy major cities, using honking as their act of discontent. In Ottawa, the national capital, protesters have been present for two weeks, organizing dancing, free meal distributions, children’s entertainment, and other activities that have given the protests a festival atmosphere.The protesters are most urgently opposed to Chinese coronavirus vaccine mandates and sanitary mask mandates but have also called for the government to stop limiting assemblies and shutting down businesses.Anti-vaccine mandate protestors block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on February 11, 2022. (GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty Images)The polling firm Maru Group found in a poll published Monday that nearly half of Canadians, 48 percent, believe Trudeau “is not up to the job of being prime minister.” Only 35 percent say that he is. The protests appear to be clearly to blame: only 16 percent said that Trudeau’s handling of the “Freedom Convoy” made them want to vote for him, compared to 63 percent actively discouraged to do so by the handling of the situation. A majority, 53 percent, believe that Trudeau has not acted in a way befitting a prime minister in the face of the protests.The numbers are not an indication of any widespread support for the protests. On the contrary, the respondents’ distaste for Trudeau appears to be coming from disagreement with the protests and a sense that the protesters are winning while Trudeau fails to act, making him appear “weak.” In a separate poll published Saturday, 56 percent said they did not support the “Freedom Convoy” “in any way, shape or form.” A higher number, 64 percent, said they considered the protesters a threat to democracy; the same number “support using the Canadian Armed Forces” to clear out the trucks.Yet over half in the Monday survey, 53 percent of respondents, said that Trudeau looked weak when facing the “Freedom Convoy,” compared to 17 percent who said yes when asked if he looked “strong” in his attempts to stop the protests. Another 44 percent said that they believed Trudeau had personally worsened the situation.Both polls were conducted from February 9 to 10.Maher to Trudeau: ""…you do sound like Hitler."" https://t.co/yk8qU3EoiK— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 12, 2022Another recent poll, published by Abacus Data and spark*advocacy on February 8, found that Ottawa residents, in particular, appear to blame Trudeau more than any other local leader. More than half of respondents, 56 percent, rated Trudeau’s handling of the protests as “poor” or “very poor,” more than Mayor Jim Watson, Premier Doug Ford, the police, or the city council. That number among the majority in the capital who said they opposed the protests, 54 percent said Trudeau was handling the protests “poorly” or “very poorly;” that number rose to 64 percent among those who support the protesters.Nearly half, 49 percent, of all respondents said Trudeau should meet the protesters. The vast majority, 88 percent, who support the protests said the same. Trudeau has adamantly ruled out doing so.The Maru poll found limited national support for the “Freedom Convoy” but more than the support Abacus Data found in Ottawa, where the largest iteration of the trucker protests has currently parked itself. This disapproval makes Trudeau’s lamentable support an even bigger political problem, particularly in light of the growing public condemnation of Trudeau from the left.Trucks approach the Ambassador Bridge border crossing in Windsor, Ontario on February 14, 2022.

(GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty)Trudeau faced widespread criticism from all sides of the debate for his abrupt disappearance at the beginning of the convoy, which he blamed on a positive test for Chinese coronavirus. Trudeau hid in an “undisclosed location” for a week due to his medical condition, but took time out of his quarantine to issue a public statement confirming he will never meet with the protesters for any reason and calling them “conspiracy theorists.”“The concerns expressed by a few people gathered in Ottawa, right now, are not new, not surprising, are heard, but are a continuation of what we’ve unfortunately seen in disinformation and misinformation,” Trudeau said from the undisclosed location in late January, “online conspiracy theorists, about microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats.”Trudeau had previously described people who did not choose to ingest a Chinese coronavirus vaccine product as “racist” and “misogynist,” without elaborating.When he finally returned to Parliament last week, he was met by multiple successive days of jeering drowning out his remarks during question time. Asked to repudiate his divisive language about the protesters, Trudeau equated them with Nazis.“A few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,” Trudeau asserted, refusing to address any concerns about open-ended civil rights curbs nationwide.Trudeau faced nearly incessant heckling on Tuesday and Wednesday.Complaints expanded to those on the left, who asked him to answer for his “stigmatizing and divisive approach” to the situation.Perhaps the most aggressive opposition Trudeau is facing from the left did not come from those concerns about his intransigent language, however, but from communist New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh, the primary promoter of a conspiracy theory that former American President Donald Trump, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and the American “alt-right” are behind the Canadian protests. Singh has used his remarks in Parliament to demand Trudeau act to cut alleged foreign aid and unveil the true puppetmasters behind the protests, not to ask for unity and reconciliation.“It is completely inexcusable,” Singh said of Trudeau’s performance in a social media video last week. “I have no idea how the prime minister of this country can sit back and let this happen. The prime minister of a G7 nation can’t solve this?”“People are fed up and we need to immediately seek leadership to fix this, to solve this, to protect people,” Singh asserted.Singh’s message appears to have resonated – 67 percent of respondents in the Maru poll that found widespread disapproval of Trudeau said they believed the protesters “are being heavily funded and supported by foreign interests.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. "

Brussels Police have warned motorists to avoid trying to drive into the city.Authorities in charge of other European cities, such as Paris and Vienna, have made similar attempts to ban demos styled on anti-mandatory vaccine protests in Canada, though all so far have been futile.According to a report by the Brussels Times, demonstrators planning on taking part in the convoy — which was banned by authorities last Thursday — had said that they were set on continuing with their plans, regardless of what local authorities say.“They can’t stop us,” one activist is reported as saying online. “Go on and fight for your freedom. Screw this shitty government, [whether this protest is] banned or not.”“As if we were going to cancel everything now because we didn’t get permission,” wrote another. “If everyone just drives up to the Ring and pulls the key out of the ignition there, it’s over.”Fresh reports Monday morning from the same outlet reports there are now 1,300 known vehicles on their way to Brussels to take part in the protest, with police patrols “stationed at key entries to the city”.

We are returning to normalcy,” Politico reports Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s Prime Minister, as saying.“There will no longer be a[n enforced] closing time … nor a limit on the number of people seated at the same table. Only staff will have to wear the mask,” the publication also notes the PM as saying.Of particular interest is the date of the loosening, however, with nightclubs across Belgium having previously threatened the government that they would re-open on that date, regardless of whether the government would allow them to or not.“…having remained too long without perspective or sufficient financial aid, the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels clubs are taking the joint initiative to reopen in the form of a festive event,” read one press release regarding the announced plan to re-open regardless of the government position."
